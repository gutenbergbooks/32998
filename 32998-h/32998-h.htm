<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE COMING OF THE RED TRIANGLE</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>His Majesty congratulates the Association on the
successful results of its war work, which has done
everything conducive to the comfort and well-being
of the armies, supplying the special and peculiar
needs of men drawn from countries so different
and distant. It has worked in a practical, economical
and unostentatious manner, with consummate
knowledge of those with whom it has to deal. At
the same time the Association, by its spirit of discipline,
has earned the respect and approbation of
the military authorities.&mdash;<span class="smcap">His Majesty the King.</span></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the summer of 1901, in the old
volunteer days, that the Y.M.C.A. for the
first time had its recreation tents at Conway
in North Wales. The Lancashire Fusiliers
were in camp, and the men had thronged the
marquee all day, turning up in great force
for the service that Sunday evening. It
seemed as if they would never tire of singing
the old familiar hymns, and when the time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
came for the address the attention of every
man was riveted from start to finish. At
length the tent cleared, and the men retired
for the night. Now and then the chorus of
a hymn could be heard coming from a bell
tent, but soon the 'Last Post' sounded, and
a few minutes later the plaintive notes of
the bugle gave the signal for 'Lights Out.'
Thereupon two of the Y.M.C.A. leaders,
leaving the camp behind, walked up and
down the sands of Morfa. It was a perfect
night; not a sound was to be heard except
the gentle ripple of the waves, three or four
hundred yards away. The moon was near
the full; everything seemed almost as light
as day, and the bold outline of the Conway
Mountain stood in clear relief against the
sky. 'I wonder what all this means,' said
one of the two, referring to the impressive
service of the evening and to the crowds
that had thronged the tents all day. 'I
have been wondering,' said he, 'if there is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
great European war looming in the distance,
and if God is preparing the Y.M.C.A. for
some great work it is destined to perform
then.' How often have those words come
back since the beginning of the war! God
was indeed preparing the Association for a
work infinitely bigger than any of its leaders
knew or even dared to hope. In those days
H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught became
Patron of our Military Camp Department,
and he has ever since been a warm friend.</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>How far distant now seem those early
days of August 1914. For weeks there had
been rumours of war, but all arrangements
had been completed for the work of the
Y.M.C.A. in the Territorial camps to proceed
as usual during the August holidays.
Then came the order for mobilisation, and
on August the 4th a council of war was
held at Headquarters, attended by Association
leaders from all parts of the country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Many of the districts were in financial difficulties,
owing to the sudden break up of
the summer camps, and the only possible
policy was the one agreed upon at the
meeting&mdash;a common programme and a
common purse. No one knew where the
men, or the money, were to come from, but
it was decided to go right ahead, and from
that resolve there could be no turning back.
It is still true that 'He that saveth his life
shall lose it, and he that loseth his life shall
find it.' In that great crisis, had the
leaders of the Y.M.C.A. stopped to consider
first the immediate or future interests of
the Association, then the Association would
have gone under, and deservedly so.
Britain was in danger, and her interests
had to be considered first.</p>

<p>What stirring days those were! We
think of one tiny village to the south-west
of Salisbury Plain, with a normal population
of two or three hundred. Within a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
few days of the opening of hostilities, thirty-four
thousand men were dumped down in
the immediate vicinity. They had no tents,
no uniforms, no rifles, nowhere to go, and
nothing to do, for the simple reason that
England did not desire war and had not
prepared for it. The General in command
had known the Y.M.C.A. in India, and came
to London to ask our help, which was
gladly given. Huge recreation tents were
opened there, and all over the country.
North, South, East, and West, Britain was
suddenly transformed into one armed camp,
and the Y.M.C.A. was never more needed
than it was in those early days. Some of
the centres were very small, others very
large. At the Y.M.C.A. in the White City,
for instance, it was no uncommon thing to
see four or five thousand men gathered
together in the great hall. At the Crystal
Palace, too, and in many of the camps,
the work was carried out on a very large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
scale, whilst in other centres a farm building,
a private house, or a tiny tent met the need.</p>

<p>Thanks to the loyal co-operation and
energy of Association leaders and workers,
two hundred and fifty of these centres were
established within ten days. They were
dotted down all over the country, and every
week that passed by showed an increase in
strength and in the number of centres,
until the sign of the Red Triangle was to be
found in more than two thousand centres in
all parts of the United Kingdom, in every
part of the Empire, on every battle-front,
and in some places where the Allied flags
do not yet fly. The hands of the Military
in those days were so full up with other
things that they had little time to devote
to the recreation of the troops, and our help
was warmly welcomed. We have acted
throughout in close co-operation with the
Military, and we should like to add our
tribute of praise to the efficiency of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Military machine, as we have come in touch
with it. Much has been said during the
war as to the marvels of German organisation,
and possibly not too much. At the
same time there is quite as much to be said
in praise of British organisation. Germany
wanted a war whilst we did not. Germany
prepared for war, tirelessly, ceaselessly;
with her eye on the goal&mdash;world-wide
dominion&mdash;she brought all her organising
ability to bear on the preparation for the
war she was determined to force on
humanity. Britain, on the other hand,
has had to improvise her war organisation
since war has been actually forced on her.
A run round the great base camps in France
will show how wonderfully complete is that
organisation&mdash;transport, supply, commissariat.
Of course there have been mistakes,
but singularly few under the circumstances.
Many people are very critical of the War
Office, but those who know most of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
difficulties that have been overcome and
the successes achieved, will be the least inclined
to join hands with the critics.</p>

<p>It is like a nightmare to think of that
first winter of the war, with its gales, rain
and mud, and it was when the weather was
at its worst that the men of the first
Canadian Contingent were encamped on
Salisbury Plain. It is difficult to conceive
what they would have done, but for the
timely help of the Red Triangle. The roads
were almost impassable, and the mud in
the vicinity of the camps appalling, but
the Canadians stuck it, and so did our
leaders and workers. The tents were
crowded to their utmost capacity, but it
was soon found that no tent could weather
the gales of Salisbury Plain in winter.
That discovery led to the evolution of the
Y.M.C.A. hut. Wooden frames covered
with canvas were tried first of all, but they,
too, were incapable of withstanding the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
fury of the gales, and something much
stronger had to be provided.</p>

<p>It meant a great deal to the country
during that first winter of the war that the
men were happy and contented, because
they had their leisure hours pleasantly
occupied, and because the most popular
place in camp was almost without exception
the one that bore the sign of the Red
Triangle. And what did they find at the
sign of the Red Triangle? They found
there an open house, a warm welcome, a
place of recreation and enjoyment, where
they could meet their friends on terms
thoroughly cordial and unofficial. Coffee
and buns were always a great attraction,
and as for music&mdash;the piano was hardly
ever silent. Tommy Atkins loves a good
tune and loves a crowd; the quiet place
does not so much appeal to him. At the
Y.M.C.A. he found diversion for his hours
of leisure; opportunity for study if he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
cared for it; libraries, classes, and lectures.
There, too, he found an expression of
religious life that appealed to him, the
inspiration that comes from religion without
the controversy and sectarian bitterness
which, alas! too often accompany it, a
religion to work by and a religion that can
do things. Before the war nobody had
heard of our mystic sign, but within a few
weeks letters bearing it had found their
way into hundreds of thousands of homes,
bringing joy and consolation wherever they
went. That, in brief, is the story of the
coming of the Red Triangle. And what is
its significance? As the emblem of the
war work of the Y.M.C.A. it has not been
chosen by chance, but because it exactly
typifies the movement it represents. The
threefold needs of men are its concern, and
its programme is adapted to meet the needs
of body, mind, and spirit, whilst its colour
symbolises sacrifice. In an old book of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
signs and wonders called <i>Mysterium Magnum</i>
the inverted triangle appears as a symbol of
the divine spirit, and in the third year of
the war a famous Belgian painter asked
'Qu'est-ce-que c'est&mdash;cet Y.M.C.A.?' and
without waiting for an answer went on to
say that the Red Triangle meant emblematically&mdash;'Spirit
informing and penetrating
matter,' which was, he supposed, the function
of the Y.M.C.A. 'The Y.M.C.A. is
attempting the impossible,' said one of its
critics; 'it is building on the apex of the
triangle.' Thank God it is. Yes! and
thank God it has achieved the impossible.
If any one had dared to foretell four years
ago, a tithe of what has already been
accomplished, no one would have believed
it. The secret of the inverted triangle is
that it is upheld by invisible hands, and it
is the full programme of the Red Triangle
that appeals so irresistibly to the men.
If we were merely out to run a canteen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
others could perhaps have done the canteen
work as well, or nearly as well, as the
Y.M.C.A. Others could run lectures for
the troops, and others cater for their
spiritual needs, but it has been left to the
Y.M.C.A. to formulate the appeal to the
whole man&mdash;Body, Mind, and Spirit&mdash;and
the appeal to every man, irrespective
of creed or party. Every man is equally
welcome in the Y.M.C.A.&mdash;Protestant,
Romanist, Anglican, Free-churchman, Jew,
Mohammedan, Buddhist, Hindoo, or
Brahmin&mdash;the men of every religion and
no religion, and yet the religious note is
ever dominant, though no man's religion
will ever be attacked from a Y.M.C.A.
platform.</p>

<p>The story of the Red Triangle is, indeed,
one of the great romances of the war. Its
work has never been regarded as an end
in itself, but rather as auxiliary to that of
other organisations. It is auxiliary to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the Church, and its doors have been thrown
wide open to the Padres of all denominations.
Protestants, Catholics, Jews&mdash;even
Mohammedans&mdash;have worshipped God in
their own way within the hospitable walls
of the Association. It has been auxiliary
to the official medical services of the Army,
the R.A.M.C., and the Red Cross&mdash;in
hospitals and convalescent camps, and
with the walking wounded at the clearing
stations at the Front. It has arranged
concerts and entertainments by the thousand
for patients and nurses; has looked
after the friends of dangerously wounded
men, and has often handed over its huts
to be used as emergency hospitals; while
in hosts of other ways which can never be
recorded, it has been able to render vitally
important service. It has been auxiliary
to the Military machine at every turn of
the war. In the midst of the camp though
not of it, its secretaries and workers conform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to military rules and are subject to
discipline, although they are themselves
civilians. In this way the Association has
provided the human touch, and officers
and men alike have appreciated the fact
that there is one place in camp where
discipline through being temporarily relaxed,
has been permanently strengthened.</p>

<p>The Romance of the Red Triangle, like
the story of the first crusade, has been the
romance of the pioneer. The Y.M.C.A.
was first in the field, though now there
are many other organised societies and
private individuals doing similar work
on the lines which it thought out and
proved to be practicable. Indeed, the
whole story of the Y.M.C.A. has been full
of adventurous episodes of romance, not
merely during the war, but long before
it, commencing seventy years ago, when
George Williams came as a boy from
Somerset to London, and as one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
a band of twelve intrepid young men,
founded the first branch of a movement
destined to spread to all corners of the
world. It is only during these years of
war that the Society has fully come into
its own, and received universal recognition,
but we do not forget that to those pioneers
of the early Victorian days and to the
Y.M.C.A. leaders, who during the years
before the war hammered out a policy for
work amongst soldiers in the Volunteer
and Territorial camps, the widespread
movement of to-day is largely due.</p>

<p>To know what the Army thinks of the
Y.M.C.A., one need only note, on the one
hand, the facilities given to the Association
by officers in high command; and on the
other, how the N.C.O.'s and men&mdash;officers
and officer-cadets too&mdash;make use of the
huts.</p>

<span class="caption">HUT IN THE GROUNDS OF THE RUINS OF THE H&Ocirc;TEL-DE-VILLE AT ARRAS</span>
</div>

<p>Prior to one of our great advances in
1917, the district to be attacked was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
reconstructed behind the line in a large
map carefully worked out on the ground,
every road and path being clearly marked.
Every trench, redoubt, and dug-out;
every hedge and ditch was recorded, and
every gun emplacement shown. 'Reserved
for the Y.M.C.A.' was written over a
vacant plot near the centre of the map.</p>

<p>In France 'Le Triangle Rouge' is often
called 'Les Ygrecs' (The Y's), and the
Red Triangle will pass the Association
worker almost anywhere. It sounds odd
in the reserve trenches, amidst the roar of
guns and the scream of shells, to hear the
sentry's challenge as we have heard it,
'Halt! who goes there?' 'Y.M.C.A.'
'Pass, Y.M., all's well!'</p>

<span class="caption">ONE OF MANY Y.M.C.A. HUTS BUILT UNDER SHELL-FIRE</span>
</div>

<p>One of our workers in the valley of the
Somme in 1917 was left behind, as the
troops advanced to follow up the line of
the great German retreat. For weeks he
shared his Y.M.C.A. shanty with the rats,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and late one evening went for a two miles
walk. A sentry challenged him, and
evidently regarded him with suspicion.
After he had convinced the guard of his
identity, it was explained to him that
three German prisoners were at large, and
one of them was known to be wearing a
Y.M.C.A. uniform. When he awoke that
night in his rat-infested shanty it seemed
to him that if the three Huns chanced to
know of his whereabouts, it would not be a
difficult thing for them to possess themselves
of yet another Y.M.C.A. uniform!</p>

<p>In the early days of the war it was
agreed that no request for the help of the
Association, which on investigation proved
a definite need to exist, should be refused,
and God honoured the faith of those who
dared to make the resolve. The way the
movement has grown and is growing still
is nothing short of a romance, and the
following pages tell the story of service<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
rendered under the sign of the Red
Triangle to the men of His Majesty's
Forces, irrespective of class, creed, or
party, in England and north of the Border,
in Wales and Ireland, on every battle-front
and in every base; amongst men of
every colour and creed who are serving
under our great Flag&mdash;the Flag that
stands for Freedom.</p>

<p>Possibly the greatest romance of all
will be that dealing with the work of the
Red Triangle after the war. Who knows?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>BLAZING THE TRAIL WITH THE RED TRIANGLE</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>Few organisations have done so much in caring for
the comfort and well-being of our soldiers as your
Associations. They have given invaluable help to
the Army, and have immeasurably lightened the
hardships which have to be endured by our troops.
In recognising the excellent work that has already
been done, I should like to wish you success in that
which you still propose to undertake. I consider
that your plans for after the war are not the least
important of your activities.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Right Hon.
David Lloyd George, M.P.</span></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Red Triangle is often to be found in
unexpected places. 'A wonderful, friendly
old octopus, this Y.M.C.A.' was the way
an Australian put it, and it was not at
all a bad description of the ubiquitous
Red Triangle. Tommy recognises it to-day
as his club, his meeting house, his
home from home. It is his, and he knows
it! It touches him at every point and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in almost every place. The recruit finds
it at his dep&ocirc;t, near his billet, and in the
training camp where he learns to be a
soldier; indeed, it is part of the training,
and an important part, too. Passing
through London or a great provincial
city, he can stay the night in one of the
Y.M.C.A. hostels; he meets it again at
the English ports before he embarks for
one of the fighting fronts; it is there to
greet him on the other side, not only at
the ports of entry and in the base camps,
but on the lines of communication in
France, Italy, Egypt, Palestine, Mesopotamia,
and right up the line, in cellar or
dug-out as well as in rest-camp and at
railhead. If he should have the misfortune
to be wounded he may expect to find the
Association at the casualty clearing station
or in the hospital, and later on in the
convalescent camp, or, if invalided out
of the army, it will still stick to him and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
befriend him at a time when he is likely
to need a friend. If he is numbered
amongst the missing and finds himself in a
prisoner of war camp in Germany, even
then he may not be beyond the outreach
of the Association. There is at least one
redeeming feature to the prisoner of war
camp in Ruhleben in Germany, for right
in the heart of it there is a little brown
hut with the Red Triangle and the letters
'Y.M.C.A.' on the roof&mdash;one of several in
Germany erected with American Y.M.C.A.
money, at a time when America was a
neutral state, and run entirely by British
prisoners of war for the benefit of their
fellow-Britishers, who also have the misfortune
to be prisoners of war.</div>

<p>It is little we can do for these brave
lads who are wearing their hearts out
longing to hear the voices of those they
love in the Homeland, but the Y.M.C.A.
does what it can.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>This girdle of loving-kindness is completed
in the Internment Camps of Switzerland&mdash;at
M&uuml;rren, Leysin, Interlaken,
Meiringen, and Seeburg, and in those of
Holland at Scheveningen, Rotterdam, The
Hague, and Groningen. None need our
help more than the officers and men of
those internment camps. It was one of
the latter who said he would rather be in
Germany than in the internment camp in
Switzerland, for in Germany, said he, one
has, at any rate, the excitement of trying
to escape; but now, working hand-in-hand
with the British Red Cross, the Red Triangle
provides recreation and employment for
the long hours of leisure, and there can be
no doubt as to the appreciation of those
it seeks to serve.</p>

<p>A worker at Cambridge went to a
neighbouring village to arrange a flag
day on behalf of our war fund. He was
advised to get in touch with the post-mistress,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
who was keenly interested in the
movement. 'Of course, I am interested,'
she said when he saw her, 'and if you will
come into my sitting-room I will show
you why.' There on the wall in a little
room at the back of the post-office was
what she called her Roll of Honour&mdash;the
photographs of twelve lads from her
Bible class, all serving with His Majesty's
Forces. 'Eleven out of the twelve,' said
she, 'write me almost every week, and
tell me what a boon the Y.M.C.A. is to
them. That is why I am ready to do all
I can to help you with your Flag Day.'
The sequel was interesting. Half an hour
later No. 12 called to see her. 'How
strange,' she cried; 'I was just talking
about you, and saying you were the only
one of the boys who never wrote expressing
appreciation of the Y.M.C.A.' 'That
is easily explained,' was the reply. 'I
have been at sea since the early days of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the war, and have had no opportunity of
getting ashore and using the Y.M.C.A.
until three months ago, when I was sent
to Egypt and stationed at the Mena camp.
There I used the Association hut within
sight of the great pyramid, and I appreciate
the work as much as anyone to-day.'</p>

<p>A young soldier who was formerly a
Y.M.C.A. worker wrote from France:&mdash;'We
came upon the Prussian Guard about
ten days ago, and for five days and nights
we fought hand to hand like demons,
but in the end we gained our objective.
You talk of the work of the Y.M.C.A. at
home as splendid. I know it is, but here
the Y.M.C.A.'s are more. In this place,
famous for its wonderful bell tower, the
Y.M.C.A. is in full swing, although only
yesterday it was shelled heavily and
shrapnel was falling pretty thick along the
road. Cheero!' Another young soldier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
wrote from Malta, and gave his experience
of the Y.M.C.A. 'The Association is the
finest thing that was ever instituted
without doubt. The Army has blessed
the fact many a time. I have served in
France and a few other countries, and
am in a position to know.'</p>

<p>In the early days of the war Y.M.C.A.
secretaries learned to adapt all kinds of
premises, no matter how primitive, to
meet the needs of the troops. A cow-house
amid the trenches of the East
Coast; a pigsty in the south-west of
England, neither of them much to look
at, but doing good service and helping to
blaze the trail; a dug-out at Anzac and
three tiny marquees at Cape Helles; a
cellar at Meroc, just behind the British
lines in the neighbourhood of Loos; a
ch&acirc;teau formerly the residence of the lord
of the manor at Mazingarbe, and a palatial
but ruined Technical Institute at Armenti&egrave;res.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
It was fixed up in a convent at Aire&mdash;the
first Y.M.C.A. to be opened in a forward
position in France, and inside a ruined
hospice at Ypres; in a Trappist monastery
on the Mont des Cats; in the most southern
city in the world at Invercargill; above
the clouds with the British troops in
Italy; inside some of the German prisoner
of war camps in Germany; in the old
German Consulate at Jaffa, in the heart of
the Holy City, and on the Palestine lines
of communication at Gaza and Beersheba.
'The Jolly Farmer' near Aldershot, and
the more notorious 'Bolger's' public house
in Sackville Street, Dublin, made their
appearance early in the war under the
sign of the Red Triangle, whilst Ciro's, the
once famous night club in the heart of
London, and the mansions of Viscount
Wimborne and Lord Brassey have also
been thrown open for the service of the
Association.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The trail of the Red Triangle was first
blazed in the United Kingdom, and since
then it has become familiar on every fighting
front, and in all sorts of queer and unexpected
places: in the jungle of India;
on the banks of the Tigris, the Euphrates,
and the Nile; amid the swamps of East
Africa; along the valley of the Jordan;
in the Egyptian desert; in the great
training camps of North America; in
Australasia and South Africa, as well as
in the plains of Flanders and Picardy;
in the valleys of the Somme, the Marne,
the Meuse, and the Aisne. It is to be
found on the Varda and the Struma, and
we have seen for ourselves how that trail
has been welcomed by men of many
nationalities&mdash;Britons from the Homeland
and from the outposts of Empire, from
Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New
Zealand, and South Africa; Indians,
Chinese, Cape Boys and Kaffirs, Frenchmen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Portuguese, and Belgians, and wherever
the trail of the Red Triangle goes it
stands for reconstruction even amid the
horrors and desolation of war.</p>

<p>An officer cadet who had spent two
years in France, said he had noticed a
great change in the attitude of the men.
'In the early days of the war,' said he,
'men on arriving in new billets at the
Front would say, "Is there no Y.M.C.A.
in the village?" Later on they took it
for granted that the Red Triangle was
there and asked, "Where is the Y.M.C.A.?"
Now they always say, "Where is it?"
and every one knows to what they refer.'
It brings comfort, hope, good cheer, and
inspiration with it. An English boy
writing home from Egypt to his people in
the Midlands, said that the Y.M.C.A. was
to him as 'a bit of Heaven in a world that
was otherwise all hell.' A visitor to the
Association at Kantara expressed his surprise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
at finding such a splendid Y.M.C.A.
building in that Egyptian centre, fitted
up even with hot and cold baths!</p>

<p>A sum of &pound;400 was taken in a single day
over the refreshment counter in one of
the Y.M.C.A. marquees in the heart of the
Sinai Peninsula, and it will give an idea
of the immense amount of work involved
to the staff of the Association, when it is
remembered that all stores had to be
conveyed from the railhead to the Y.M.C.A.
on the backs of camels.</p>

<p>A British soldier writing from the
'Adam and Eve' hut in Mesopotamia
said, 'I should like to comment upon the
wonderful work the Y.M.C.A. is doing
here among the troops. In almost every
large camp there is a Y.M.C.A. hut, a
veritable haven in the desert, not only for
canteen, but religious work also. I attended
a service in the hut, and it made a
good impression on me. We sang the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
good old hymns, and I am sure we all felt
refreshed.'</p>

<p>As might be expected, the Dominions
have done their full share of pioneering,
and have blazed the trail in many different
directions. The Canadians have done a
great work at Shorncliffe, Sandling, Bramshott,
and Witley; in the Forestry camps
at home and right up the line in France.
The Australians on Salisbury Plain, at
Weymouth, and in many other home
centres have served their troops splendidly;
whilst in France, Egypt, the Dardanelles,
and Palestine their pioneering work has
been great. The New Zealanders at Sling
Plantation, Hornchurch, and other centres
at home, have done equally well, and their
pioneering work overseas has been most
efficient. The South Africans have done
valuable work in the Military Expedition
to Swakopmund and in East Africa. India
has made a great contribution to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Empire work of the Red Triangle, first of
all by catering for the needs of British
troops quartered in India itself, and also
in Mesopotamia and East Africa, where
the work has been directed from India, as
has that for the Indian troops in France.
Passing reference should also be made here
to the great programme of work undertaken
and planned by the Y.M.C.A.'s
of the United States. In the United
Kingdom, in France, Russia and Italy,
as well as in North America, they have projected
work on an enormous scale, in fact,
all the Allied countries are closely co-operating
in the work of the Red Triangle.
It has been the privilege of the British
Associations to provide huts for the exclusive
use of Belgian, Serbian, and
Portuguese troops, and to cater for the
needs of American and Colonial soldiers in
hundreds of centres. In London, for
instance, special facilities have been given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to New Zealanders at the Shakespeare
hut; we were able to procure for the
Canadian Y.M.C.A. the magnificent Tivoli
site on which their fine hostel now stands,
and to hand over the group of huts to the
Americans which formed the nucleus of
the Eagle Hut. The Australians rented and
furnished the Aldwych Theatre on their own
account. The New Zealand Y.M.C.A.'s
made a handsome contribution towards the
cost of the Shakespeare Hut, and the whole
of the cost of the Eagle and Beaver Huts
has been borne by the American and
Canadian Y.M.C.A.'s, respectively. The
American and Colonial Associations have
taken over a number of British huts in
camps, and in some cases have enlarged
them.</p>

<h3>FLOTSAM AND JETSAM</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>In my opinion nothing can exceed the value of the
work which has been and is being done for H.M.
Forces by the Y.M.C.A. I offer my best wishes
for continued success.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Right Hon. H. H.
Asquith, K.C., M.P.</span></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> Romance of the Red Triangle is a
twenty-four hours a day romance, for
many of its centres never close their
doors. When we are comfortably sleeping
at night and in the early hours of the
morning, Y.M.C.A. workers are hard at
work on motor patrol conveying leave
men from station to station or hut to hut,
and others are on foot meeting the men
and guiding them to their destination.
Alighting from the Edinburgh train at
Leeds very early one morning, it was
raining and a young Scottish trooper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
stepped down to the platform from the
adjoining compartment. We knew we
were all right, a room having been retained
for us at the Station Hotel; but what of
him? Had he anywhere to go? He evidently
had no plans, but at that moment
a gentleman in civilian attire stepped up
to him, and without patronising, and in
the most natural way possible said to him,
'Have you long to wait? Have you
anywhere to go?' The lad replied that
he had several hours to wait for his connection
and had nowhere to go. 'Well,
come along with me, and I will see you all
right at the Y.M.C.A.' People who do this
work or devote themselves, night after
night, to that of the motor patrols don't
often get their photos into the papers,
but they are rendering national service
of a high order without fee or reward, and
in almost every case, at the end of a hard
day's work.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The International Hospitality League
of the Y.M.C.A. is doing similar work on
a very large scale, and in its kiosks and
inquiry rooms, not only in London, but in
Glasgow, Edinburgh, and many of our
large provincial centres hundreds of thousands
of inquiries are being received and
answered day by day, whilst the street
patrol workers have been able to help
very many who have welcomed their
assistance.</p>

<p>We know of no more moving sight than
one of the great Triage huts in France
when leave is on. We think of our last
visit to one such. Three hundred men were
sleeping there that night, and 'Uncle Joe,'
the Y.M.C.A. leader, went round the
bunks last thing to see them safely tucked
in. As we stood in the main hall we
thought we understood what was said of
our Lord that 'when He saw the multitude
He was filled with compassion.' Scores<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of men were gathered around the piano,
singing rowdy choruses of the kind loved
by our Tommies. The coffee queue extended
the whole length of the room, and
the men had to buy their tickets from
Uncle Joe, who had a few words with each
in homely Lancashire dialect, whilst
further along the counter a titled lady was
serving coffee as fast as she could pour it
out. There were crowds round the tables,
reading or feeding. We noticed at one
table a group of men, one of whom was
cutting up a long French loaf, another
had just opened a tin of sardines which he
was sharing round, whilst a third was
helping his comrades from a tin of pears.
All were on their way home on leave, or
returning to the Front, and all were
merry and happy as British Tommies
almost invariably are.</p>

<p>Sometimes in a London hut, or it may
be in the Y.M.C.A. in Paris, you will come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
across one of these Tommies who is down
and out. He has been on leave and has
spent or lost all his money, and is down
on his luck. It is to the Y.M.C.A. he
turns. A little act of kindness, under such
circumstances, has often changed a man's
whole outlook on life. Nearly the whole
of the service in the Y.M.C.A. hostels is
rendered voluntarily, and many workers
who have home or business ties welcome
this opportunity of doing war service
that really counts. There is a tendency
in some quarters to speak disparagingly
of the voluntary worker, but those who
know, realise the enormous value of such
service. No paid workers could have been
more zealous or more efficient than those
who have served voluntarily under the
Red Triangle. The old brewery in Earl
Street was the first building in London
to be adapted for sleeping purposes, but
the 'Euston' was the first Y.M.C.A.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
hostel to be built. One of the largest is
the Shakespeare Hut which was built on
the site of the proposed National Shakespeare
Memorial Theatre, kindly loaned
for the purpose. The huge building by
London Bridge was lent by the city of
London. Many of the huts occupy central
and important sites, as for instance, the
station huts at King's Cross, Victoria, and
Waterloo,&mdash;and the station hut often means
the last touch of home before men go
overseas, and that makes the work and
the personality of the workers all the
more important.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE ROMANCE OF FINANCE</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>This work has been admirably done both at home
and at the Front. Its spiritual and material value
to the men lies beyond all reckoning, and the
services of its personnel are deeply appreciated by
the men themselves.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Right Hon. A. J.
Balfour, O.M., M.P.</span></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">On</span> August 4, 1914, our plan for war work
was ready, but the 'sinews of war' were
lacking. Little could be done without
money. In our extremity we laid the
whole position before one of our most
generous leaders and supporters, and told
him of the opportunity we saw facing the
Y.M.C.A. 'If we are to seize the opportunity,'
we said, 'it is absolutely <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'necesary'">necessary</ins>
we should secure immediately twenty-five
thousand pounds!' He looked up and
smiled indulgently&mdash;'Twenty-five thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
pounds!' he cried; 'you couldn't possibly
raise three thousand pounds at a time
like this; the thing's impossible!' 'Impossible
or not,' was the reply, 'it must be
done. We mustn't even stop to think of
the future of the Y.M.C.A. Everything is
at stake, and even if we have to sell every
building and every stick of furniture we
possess we must go forward now!' That
very day a large number of telegrams and
letters were sent out from Headquarters
to friends all over the country&mdash;the first
war emergency appeal of the Red Triangle&mdash;and
within a few days the whole of the
twenty-five thousand pounds had been
raised, and we were appealing for another
fifty thousand pounds, until at the time
of writing, in August 1918, the war fund
has reached the total of nearly two and a
half millions sterling. That is a small
sum compared with the amounts raised for
Y.M.C.A. war work in the United States.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Their first appeal brought in five million
pounds, the second more than twelve
millions, and their appeal a year later, in
October 1918, is for twenty millions sterling.
Our American friends gave us a hundred
thousand pounds from the amount raised
by their second war work appeal, a generous
and much appreciated gift. People who
know little of the facts are sometimes
inclined to criticise what they regard as
the huge war expenditure of the British
Y.M.C.A.'s, but a moment's reflection will
make it clear that it has been little short
of a miracle of finance to carry out such an
enormous programme of work at a total
cost of only about one-third of the cost to
Britain alone of a single day of war. We
have always been short of money, have
always had a big overdraft at the bank,
and that largely because we have had to
finance a huge business concern without
capital. Our war fund has been secured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
partly as a result of skilful advertising,
partly through personal solicitation and in
response to postal appeals. Flag Days
and Hut Weeks also proved valuable
agencies for raising money. The full-page
Y.M.C.A. advertisements in <i>The
Times</i> and other papers were something
quite new in religious and social work
advertising, though the method has since
been widely adopted by other organisations.</div>

<p>Many touching stories are told concerning
gifts to the war fund, gifts, many of
which have not been secured as a result of
cleverly drawn advertisements, but because
the contributors have been touched directly
or indirectly by the work itself. A boy
wrote home from Flanders, 'Tell Dad if
he has any money to spare to give it to the
Y.M.C.A. as a thankoffering for what they
are doing for us chaps out here.' One
of our centres had been nearly destroyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
by a Zeppelin bomb. It was rebuilt and
the day came for the reopening. A lady
was present and expressed herself thus:
'I wanted to be here to-day, if only to
thank you for what your Association has
done for my boy. When the war broke
out,' said she, 'he went to the Crystal
Palace for his training, and found the
Y.M.C.A. there an inestimable boon. He
was sent to Blandford to complete his
training, and the Y.M.C.A. was there.
He was drafted out to Gallipoli, and to his
amazement he found the Y.M.C.A. on the
Peninsula. He was wounded and sent to
Suez, where once more the Y.M.C.A. was
a great help to him, and yesterday,' she
continued, 'I received a letter from him
from Alexandria saying he was convalescent,
and spending the whole of his spare
time in the central building of the
Association.' It is that personal touch
that has made the appeal of the Red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Triangle one of the most popular appeals of
the war.</p>

<p>A lady called one day with a novel
suggestion. She had been reading a statement
attributed to the Kaiser, in which the
All Highest is alleged to have said that if
the worst came to the worst every dog and
cat in Germany would be armed in defence
of the Fatherland. 'If the dogs and cats
of Germany are going to do that for their
country,' she said, 'why shouldn't the dogs
and cats of England pay for one of your
huts?' Quite frankly there did not
appear to be much money in the scheme,
but it could do no harm, so we encouraged
it! Imagine our surprise when a few
days later the same lady walked in with a
cheque for four hundred and fifty pounds.
There was one gift of five pounds, all the
rest had been given in smaller amounts,
and altogether upwards of two thousand
dogs and cats&mdash;or their masters and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
mistresses&mdash;had contributed. A few weeks
later the fund was closed, at just over one
thousand pounds, and there has been no
more useful centre of Y.M.C.A. war work
than the 'Dogs and Cats Hut' at Rouen,
paid for entirely by this fund.</p>

<p>The Boys and Girls fund has reached
upwards of twenty thousand pounds. We
had been speaking to the boys at Harrow
School, and the suggestion had been thrown
out that it would be a good plan to have
a 'Harrow' Hut at the Front. At the
close of the meeting the headmaster,
supporting the suggestion, said he would
give the collection in chapel the following
Sunday to the fund. The head boy
approached him afterwards and said, 'I
think, Sir, it would be a mistake to make
a collection for the Y.M.C.A. on Sunday.
If you do the boys will think they have
done their bit, and won't bother any
further. Won't you let us make a whip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
up round the houses and see what we can
do?' Thus it was agreed, and the five
hundred pounds, which in those days was
the cost of a hut, was raised in less than a
week. We have seen that hut in France,
and know how much it was appreciated.
During the German advance in Picardy it
had to be temporarily abandoned, but
fortunately was speedily occupied again.</p>

<p>In the early days of the Euston hut,
the vicar of a neighbouring parish was
keenly interested, and told the children in
his day school what he had seen in the hut.
At the close of his address a deputation
of the older children waited on him and
told him they were interested in what he
told them, and would much like to help
the Y.M.C.A. in its work for the soldiers.
'You help?' queried the vicar; 'how
can you help?' He knew how poor they
were. To his surprise they had their
scheme ready, and their plans cut and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
dried. 'This time every year,' said the
spokesman, 'we put by our pennies and
our ha'pennies for our annual treat. We
don't feel like having a treat this year
when all this terrible fighting is taking
place. We would rather give the money
to the Y.M.C.A. to spend on the soldiers
and sailors.' A few days later, the leader
of the Euston hut was sitting at a table
in the central hall when his attention was
attracted by a group of ragged children,
standing round the entrance. Curiously
they would peer inside and then step back,
until two or three bolder than the others
walked right in as if the whole place
belonged to them. That was too much for
the leader. He went up to them and
cried, 'You must run away; this place
isn't for boys and girls, it's for soldiers and
sailors.' Looking up into his face a little
ragged youngster retorted, 'Please, sir,
we've given our money towards this show,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and we want to see how it's run!' On
inquiry, it was ascertained that the children
belonged to one of the poorest of the
schools in the north of London, and out of
their poverty they had given no less than
thirty shillings, nearly the whole of it in
pennies and farthings. Many memorial
gifts have been received, and a hut that
will be an inspiration and help to tens of
thousands, is surely one of the most
suitable of memorials.</p>

<p>Business firms and merchant princes
have given their thousands; others, with
equal generosity, have contributed shillings.
In the Channel Islands, there was a fish-hawker,
named Richards, who eked out a
slender livelihood by selling fish on the
streets of Jersey. The coming of the war
hit him so hard that he was compelled
to leave for France to seek other employment.
He got a job under the contractors
who were building the hutments in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Harfleur Valley. He did well, and eventually
returned home to Jersey. The Sunday
after his return, his minister was taking
up special collections for the hut fund.
Richards had found the Red Triangle
huts at Havre a great boon, and on entering
the church at the evening service,
handed his minister a little paper packet
containing coins. The padre fingered the
parcel and said to himself, 'He has given
six pennies, a generous gift, too, under
the circumstances!' Imagine his surprise
on opening the packet to find there six
half-crowns. He said, 'You ought not to
give so much; you can't possibly afford
it.' 'When I remember all the Y.M.C.A.
did for me when a stranger in France
and homeless,' was his reply, 'I can't
possibly do less, and wish I could give
more.'</p>

<p>A flower-seller at a popular seaside
holiday resort for many months has given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to the local Y.M.C.A. hut a shillingsworth
of flowers each week, as a thankoffering
for what the Association has done for her
husband and son.</p>

<p>At Taunton a farm labourer called at
the back door of the house of the president
of the local Y.M.C.A., and said he wanted
to help the war fund. It was the only
thing he could do to help the men at the
Front. He had tried to enlist several
times, but they would not have him. He
laid on the table fifty one-pound notes,
and went back to his work on the farm.
Inquiries elicited the fact that he had
given practically the whole of his savings,
and had done it in spite of his employer's
urgent advice to the contrary.</p>

<p>At the close of a meeting held by one
of our workers, an elderly lady came to
him and said if he would go to her house
she would give him a sovereign. He went,
and she gave him the coin, and then closing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the door of her private room, said, 'And
now I am going to give you the most
precious possession I have in the world.'
Her voice choked with emotion as she
proceeded, 'Years, many years ago, I
was to have been married. The arrangements
were made, the day fixed, and
the ring bought, and&mdash;<i>then he died!</i>'
And she sobbed as she spoke. Going to
a bureau she took out a little box and,
handing it to him, said, 'The wedding
ring is in there. I have kept it all these
years, but I promised the Lord I would
only keep it until He showed me what He
would have me do with it, and He told me
while you were speaking. I give it to
you for the Y.M.C.A. and for the boys,'
and she turned away utterly broken up.
Thousands of incidents could be related
of equal interest to the foregoing, did
space permit, and all these incidents combine
to give a personal interest to the fund.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
We can only add that the greatest possible
care has been taken to administer the
fund wisely and so avoid waste, or anything
that savours of extravagance. Of
course, Y.M.C.A. finance has come in for
criticism. Certain people who have visited
the huts, and have seen the enormous
business there transacted have come to
the conclusion that either very large
profits are being made, or that the business
methods of the Association leave much to be
desired. The question has frequently been
asked, 'What is done with the profits?'
and the fiction has got abroad that the
Y.M.C.A. publishes no accounts and is
amassing huge sums of money. The real
position is easily stated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Y.M.C.A. does not do trading
for trading's sake, but because through
its trading department it is the better
enabled to meet the needs of the
troops, and also because profits on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
trading mean further extension. So
rapid has been the development of the
war work of the Y.M.C.A., that not
only has every penny of profit been
spent on the maintenance and development
of this work for soldiers and
sailors, but it has been necessary to
raise large sums of money in subscriptions
to meet the ever-increasing
demand for extension. Every new
centre means, or may mean, an additional
burden on the central fund or
on the divisional funds for which the
National Council is ultimately responsible.
First, there is the cost of the
hut, which may mean &pound;750 or may run
into thousands&mdash;it all depends upon
size and site. The initial cost may be
defrayed by an individual gift to the
central war fund, but usually to make
the hut large enough for its purpose,
additional money has to be spent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
whilst the furnishing will probably cost
from one to three hundred pounds, or
more. Also, it must carry stock to
the value of a hundred pounds or
possibly much more if it is a big camp.
A very big turnover in a Triangle hut
may represent a very small profit, <i>e.g.</i>
there are enormous sales of stamps and
postal orders, and all these are sold for
actual cost, and, what is more, the
Association has to bear the loss of
shortages. Then there are the things
the Y.M.C.A. does free of any charges
whatever, <i>e.g.</i> there are no club fees
and no charges for admission to concerts,
lectures, or entertainments in the
ordinary hut. Free writing paper and
envelopes are at the present time costing
more than &pound;90,000 a year. Thousands
of pounds are spent on cricket
and football outfits, games generally,
books, pictures, and literature for free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
distribution. Hot drinks and refreshments
are given free to the walking
wounded on a very large scale, and
practically every one of the two thousand
war Y.M.C.A.'s keeps 'open
house' at Christmas. The work of
the Y.M.C.A. for the relatives of
wounded is very costly, especially in
France, many hostels being maintained
for that purpose. Motor transport
is an expensive item for which
there is no return, and very large sums
of money are spent on lectures and
educational work. It is estimated that
the Y.M.C.A. educational programme
in France alone may ultimately cost
the Association fifty thousand pounds a
year. When the request has come to
open a new centre, the determining
factor has been, 'Is it needed?' not
'Will it pay?' Indeed many huts
in isolated centres cannot possibly be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
made to pay, and yet they mean everything
to the men who use them. The
spending department of the Association
has been built up with the greatest
care. A body of well-known business
men meets for hours every week and
watches expenditure as a cat watches
a mouse. The Acting Treasurer of the
War Emergency Fund is a partner in
a big firm of Indian Merchants, and
devotes himself with untiring energy
and conspicuous ability to the supervision
of accounts and to the expenditure.
The accounts are audited by a
leading firm of chartered accountants,
and the audited statement of receipts
and expenditure together with a balance
sheet, is published in <i>The Times</i> and
other papers every six months. In the
canteens it is a matter of principle to
give full value for money spent, but
towards the war services the profits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
made have been equal to a sum of
ten shillings for every pound contributed
by the public. Owing chiefly to
the enormous stores that have to be
maintained in France and Overseas
generally, the Bank overdraft of the
war fund has often reached four and
five hundred thousand pounds. It is
thus not difficult to see what is done
with the profits. The Y.M.C.A. might,
had it so chosen, have feathered its nest
during the war, but with a sublime,
though by no means a reckless disregard
of the future it stepped right into the
breach, and went straight forward to
meet the national need.</p></div>

<p>As a Y.M.C.A. we pride ourselves on
the business management of our work.
We insist on business methods being
adopted, and we do not mix our business
with philanthropy&mdash;the Association hut
is not a charity as far as its business side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
is concerned. The average hut in a large
camp is expected to pay its way, so that
subscriptions from the general public can
be applied to the extension of the work
and to the maintenance of centres that
cannot be self-supporting.</p>

<p>The War Office, in the early stages of
the war, asked us to pay a rebate of
10 per cent. on the gross takings of the
refreshment department. After full consideration,
we came to the conclusion that
we could only do this by extracting the
money from the pockets of the men, who
for the most part are miserably paid, by
paying it out of subscriptions given by the
public, or by limiting the extension of the
work. Neither alternative seemed desirable
or in the interests of the men, and after
many conferences with the Quartermaster-General's
department at the War Office, it
was agreed, by mutual consent and at the
suggestion of the War Office, to refer the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
matter for decision to the Secretary of
State for War. It was at the time Lord
Kitchener was in Gallipoli, and Mr. Asquith
was personally in charge. At a conference
at Downing Street the representatives of
the Board of Control Regimental Institutes
stated their case, and we had the opportunity
of replying. Mr. Asquith took
several weeks to consider the question in
all its bearings, and ultimately gave the
decision entirely in our favour, and decided
for the duration of the war we should not
be asked to pay the rebate. Later on,
the matter was reopened by Lord Derby,
and eventually it was found necessary
for the Y.M.C.A. to pay 6 per cent. on
their gross takings in huts on Military
ground, to regimental funds, and this
is a great tax on its resources. Most
of the huts are loaned free to the
Military for church parades and military
lectures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The figures of the Red Triangle are
colossal, and yet figures by themselves
fail to give an adequate idea of the magnitude
of the work, and for obvious reasons
it is impossible to make those statistics
complete. On a given date it was ascertained
that upwards of forty-five thousand
workers were giving regular service to the
war work of the Y.M.C.A. By August 31,
1918, 929,590,430 pieces of stationery had
been sent out from Y.M.C.A. Headquarters
in London for distribution amongst the
men of His Majesty's Forces. The
stationery bill by the summer of 1918 had
risen to the rate of upwards of &pound;90,000
per annum.</p>

<p>In two months one hundred and five
tents were sent out to replace the
huts and tents lost in Picardy and
Flanders.</p>

<p>In eighteen months, Triangle House,
London, the Headquarters of our Trading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE LADIES OF THE RED TRIANGLE</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>I have received Her Majesty's commands to convey
to you an expression of the Queen's sincere thanks
for the interesting information you have given
regarding the work which is being done by the
Young Men's Christian Association among the men
of the Army and Navy.

<p>Her Majesty is much pleased with the specimens
of writing-papers and envelopes, and publications,
which you have sent for her acceptance.</p>

<p>Her Majesty feels sure that the useful work which
is being carried on by the Young Men's Christian
Association in so many different centres is highly
appreciated not only by the soldiers, but also by
the community.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Her Majesty the Queen.</span></p></div>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Before</span> the war it was one of our stock
sayings that the Y.M.C.A. was a work
'for young men by young men,' and one
must recognise the fact that the man who
is a <i>man</i>&mdash;virile, strong, athletic&mdash;is the
one to whose leadership men will most
readily respond. But in the early days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the war most of our young male workers
joined up; whether we liked it or not we
had to get the help of ladies, and our
more enterprising leaders felt that after
all there were some things in Y.M.C.A.
hut work ladies could do almost as well
as men. Things have moved since then,
and now we know that much of the work
can be done infinitely better by women.
In many cases women have been entrusted
with the actual leadership of huts, and have
carried through the duties magnificently.
The Red Triangle has given the woman
her niche in the Y.M.C.A., and for the
great programme that awaits us after the
war her help will be indispensable. It
has, moreover, given the woman who had
home claims an opportunity of doing war
work that really counts, in her spare time.
The Queen and Queen Alexandra have
been graciously interested in the work of
the ladies of the Red Triangle, and many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of the ladies of the Royal House have
rendered conspicuous personal service,
amongst whom might be mentioned
H.R.H. Princess Christian, H.R.H. Princess
Louise, H.R.H. Princess Patricia of Connaught,
and H.H. Princess Marie Louise,
whilst H.H. Princess Helena Victoria as
Lady President has given time and strength
to the work without reserve, and we owe
very much to her. In the camps, ladies
have given the home touch that means so
much to the men&mdash;games, music, decorations,
and flowers have come within their
domain; they have managed the libraries,
and have in most cases taken full responsibility
for the refreshment department.
Their personal influence has been invaluable.
We remember visiting a camp somewhere
in France. It seemed to us the
roughest camp we had ever seen. The
leader told us of an encounter he had with
one of the worst of the men on the occasion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of his first visit to the place. He had
just got his tent erected, and the man
chancing to see it asked what it was.
When told that it was the Y.M.C.A., he
replied, 'You b&mdash;&mdash; men are just what we
d&mdash;&mdash; men b&mdash;&mdash; well want,' and that was
the language of the camp. Eighteen
months later we were there again and the
camp was like another place, so great was
the change for the better. The C.O. told
us he attributed that change almost entirely
to the ladies of the Red Triangle. It so
happened that one of the ladies committed
an unpardonable military offence. She
returned to England two or three days
before her permit expired. Later on,
application was made in the usual way for
the renewal of her permit. The General
concerned, who is no longer in France,
returned the application with the words
written across it over his initials&mdash;'Keep
this woman out.' The Base Commandant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
sent it in again having written on it&mdash;'Talk
about keeping this woman out, she
is of more value to me than truckloads of
parsons and chaplains!' That was his
way of putting it, not ours. We have the
greatest possible admiration for the work
of the chaplains at the Front. There is no
finer body of men on active service to-day,
and it is a privilege we greatly esteem to be
permitted to co-operate with them and to be
of some service to them in their great work.</div>

<span class="caption">BAPAUME-CAMBRAI ROAD, WITH TREES ALL CUT DOWN BY THE GERMANS</span>
</div>

<p>The ladies have always been ready to
share the risks with the men, and there
are quite a number who have made the
supreme sacrifice, including Miss Smallpage,
killed by shrapnel in one of our munition
huts in England; Miss Betty Stevenson,
killed in an air attack in France; Miss
Edith Howe, who died of cerebro-spinal
meningitis; and Miss Lee, who lost her
life in a fire in one of the huts on Salisbury
Plain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>In one of the great bases in France there
is a small camp in which at one time there
were boys only. They were too young to
fight, their job day by day was the prosaic
one of filling up petrol cans. One of these
little chaps had badly hurt his hand, and
it seemed to him the natural thing to go for
sympathy and help to the lady of the Red
Triangle. A brief examination convinced
her that the damage was serious, and she
bade him go to the doctor, whose tent was
just across the way. Very grudgingly he
trudged across to the doctor, but a few
minutes later returned with the request
that she would look at the damaged hand
and see if the doctor had attended to it
properly. She replied that it would never
do to interfere with the doctor's work and,
moreover, the doctor had no doubt done
it far better than she could have done.
Five times the lad came back with the
request, 'O Missis! do look at my hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and see if he's done it right.' The fifth
time he brought with him as an ally the
Y.M.C.A. secretary in charge, who said,
'If I were you, Miss, I would look at his
hand. The little chap will never be happy
until you do.' Then she undid the
bandages, looked at the dressing, and
bandaging it up again said, 'There, it's
just as I told you; the doctor has done it
far better than I could; run away and be
quite happy about it!' He went away,
but returned again a few minutes later,
and that time his eyes were full of tears as
he cried, 'O Missis! I did think you'd
have kissed me when you saw how bad it
was,' and, like the good woman she was, she
kissed him as his mother would have done.
Let no one think that's what the ladies
of the Red Triangle usually do, for it's
not, and yet in that simple story you have
the whole secret of the success of the war
work of the Y.M.C.A. Time, and time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
again, one has been through every base
camp in France, and has traversed the
whole British line in France and Flanders,
and wherever one has gone one has found
the men yearning for sympathy and
longing for home. Not that they want
to return home until this fight ends in
victory, for out there they have learned
what war means; they see it robbed of its
romance, and they are determined to see
it through; they fight that this war may
end war.</p>

<p>With unfailing loyalty to the high aims
of the Red Triangle and with conspicuous
ability ladies have served the Y.M.C.A.,
and through the Association the men of
His Majesty's Forces and the munition
workers, in all parts of the United Kingdom,
in France, and in every part of the Empire,
and have won for themselves a permanent
place in the movement, whatever its future
may be.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>'GUNGA DIN' OF THE RED TRIANGLE</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>'You and your Association seem to me to be truly
hitting the nail on the head, and working for the
good of our soldier-lads, one and all. I have
watched the Y.M.C.A. procedure at many camps,
and have found it exactly adapted to the wants
of large numbers of young men taken temporarily
away from their homes and normal associations.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">General
Sir Ian Hamilton.</span></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>One</span> of the most striking of Kipling's
characters was Gunga Din, the Indian water-carrier.
He was not a fighting man, but
when fighting was taking place he was in
the thick of it, risking his life that he might
carry water to slake the thirst of the
fighting man. 'Gunga Din' was the
appropriate name given to one of our
leaders in France by a British Tommy.
Those who do not know are sometimes
inclined to sneer at the Y.M.C.A. man for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
having a 'cushy' job, but it is hard work
from start to finish. His job is never
done and very often is attended with
considerable risk. His work may carry
him right into the front line trenches and
though it does not take him 'over the top,'
yet, unlike the soldier, he has not the
privilege of hitting back. His day's work
will vary according to the camp. In all
probability he will have to be up early in
the morning, to get the coffee ready.
The hut must be cleaned, and there will be
a lot of canteen work to be done. The
buying will occupy some time, and then
there will be the evening programme to
arrange and carry through. He must
maintain personal touch with the men using
the hut, so that the ideal leader must be
half a dozen men rolled into one.</div>

<p>Our greatest difficulty during the war
has been that of getting a sufficiency of
workers of the right type. Every male<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
worker is registered with the Director of
Recruiting, and we are unable to recruit
new men classified A between the ages of
18 and 52, or 18 and 45 for service overseas.</p>

<p>Twelve members of the Y.M.C.A. have
won the Victoria Cross, 3 the D.S.O.,
33 the M.C., 25 the D.C.M., and 53 the M.M.,
whilst registered at Headquarters are the
names of 1223 who have made the supreme
sacrifice. We think of many whose war
work for the Y.M.C.A. has earned the title
of 'Gunga Din,' as, for example, the young
leader of the New Zealand work in France.
He looks a boy, but is a genius for organising,
and the pioneer of the work of the Red
Triangle in advanced positions. Another
man who has the instincts of the pioneer is
the leader of the Australian workers in
Egypt and Palestine, and yet another, a
well-known Y.M.C.A. worker who, after
doing good service in England in the
early days of the war, went to represent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Headquarters in Egypt. Torpedoed <i>en
route</i> he took up his new work with
characteristic enthusiasm and made good.
Hundreds have rendered equally valuable
service, so that it would be invidious to
mention names.</p>

<p>In the great retreat, it was the
D.A.Q.M.G. of the &mdash;&mdash; Corps who asked
us to open up a Stragglers' Post at
Westoutre. 'You are the people who can
cheer up the men,' said he; 'I want you to
get hold of the stragglers before they
become deserters.' It was 'Gunga Din'
he needed, but this time with cocoa-urn
instead of water-bottle, and it was only an
old bank to which our workers fixed their
Red Triangle, but it was just what was
needed. A bursting shell forced them to
quit, but half an hour later they had
opened up again in the village shop, opposite
the church, and the mayor thanked
them later on for their successful efforts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Our officers' hut at Romerin was set on
fire by a shell; shells were falling fast,
and the larger hut soon became untenable,
but the Y.M.C.A. man was running his show
in the open under a tree, and was as busy
as ever. The ubiquitous 'Ford' did its
bit, and its load would sometimes consist
of the Divisional Secretary himself, one or
two other workers or Belgian refugees, a
big caterer's boiler, a tea-urn, together with
cases of biscuits and cigarettes. Thus
equipped, it would proceed to some
advanced dressing-station. Sometimes
there would only be a sergeant and orderlies
in charge, heroically doing their best to
help the wounded, and the mere presence
of a man like one of our secretaries gave
them confidence, whilst the steaming hot
drinks he soon had ready gave new courage
to the wounded men who thronged the
C.C.S. A great work of the 'Gunga Din'
type was done on the Nieppe-Bailleul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
road during the retreat. What an amazing
scene it must have been; an endless stream
of refugees and wounded; units lost;
batteries firing; men who had been for
days without food, moving about like
ghosts and digging themselves in at the
side of the road. The Huns were only
about eight hundred yards further along
the road, and our soldiers fired as they
walked. For three nights none of our
workers even thought of going to bed;
they stood by with cars ready to help where
and how they were most needed, and gave
help to soldiers and refugees alike. At
dressing and casualty clearing stations they
gave emergency help. At Remy, for
instance, one of our men was told off to
undress the wounded and rig them out
in new pyjamas, whilst another made
himself useful in cleaning the floors. Hot
drinks were given out freely in all these
centres just behind the line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Following the British victory at Messines
on June 7, 1917, a Leeds minister serving
on the staff of the Y.M.C.A. wrote home
describing the work for the walking
wounded as he had seen it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'It was about three o'clock in the
morning when the signal to advance was
given, and the boys went over the
parapet. About two hours later the
wounded began to arrive at our hospital
in ambulance vans. It had been previously
arranged that only as far as
possible walking cases&mdash;men slightly
wounded&mdash;should be dealt with at our
station, and the expeditious and
efficient way in which their wounds
were attended to reflected great credit
on the medical staff. As soon as they
left the dressing-room they were passed
on to our Y.M.C.A., where we supplied
them with various kinds of refreshments
free. It was my great privilege<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to serve the first patient, who had a
broken arm, with a freshly-made cup
of tea and a sandwich, and never shall
I forget his look and words of appreciation.
Some were too ill to eat anything
for a time, especially those who
had been gassed or were suffering from
shell-shock, but they were very glad
of a seat on the grass in the shade of our
tent. Some were so badly wounded
that they were unable to speak, while
others were half deaf and dumb as the
result of shock. It was pathetic to
see such men scribbling their request
for a drink on a piece of paper. All
were loud in their praise of the Y.M.C.A.
and many were quite overcome when
they realised that the tea, lemonade,
cigarettes, and various kinds of eatables
were provided free. One Scottish New
Zealander, whose father is a well-known
seed merchant in Edinburgh, declared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that the Y.M.C.A. was the greatest
thing in the war. In addition to
attending to the needs of the "inner
man"&mdash;and some of them we had to
feed like babies, as both hands were
wounded&mdash;we wrote letters and field
cards for them, and tried in every
possible way to add to their comfort.
The spirit manifested by the majority
of them was simply splendid, and
scarcely ever did they refer to their
own suffering and hardships.'</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>IN THE TRAIL OF THE HUN</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>It has given me great pleasure to learn of the
development of the Y.M.C.A. work in France and
England during the last six months. In particular
I am very glad to hear of the successful growth of
the experiment begun at Aire.

<p>No one can be long in this country without realising
the immense value of your organisation, and the
constant extension of your activities itself testifies
to the high regard in which it is held by our
soldiers.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig.</span></p></div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> history of the British Empire has been
written over again, and written in blood,
in the valleys of the Somme, the Ancre,
and the Scarpe. Tens of thousands of
our noblest and best lie buried in these
valleys or on the tableland of Peronne,
situated between the insignificant rivers
that have within the past few months
earned a world-wide notoriety. No one
can visit a modern battlefield without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
realising something of the appalling waste
of war. Towns and villages have been
blotted out of existence, or are marked
to-day by a few unrecognisable ruins.
Thanks to the efficiency of British organisation,
excellent roads were quickly established
right through the stricken district,
and it was impossible to traverse any of
them without marvelling at the obstacles
overcome and the successes gained. The
road, for instance, from Albert to
Bapaume, through Pozieres, Le Sars, and
Warlincourt, passing close by Contalmaison
and Martincourt, was contested
almost yard by yard, and the same thing
may be said of the road that leads along
the bank of the Ancre from Albert past
the Leipzig Redoubt, near Thiepval and
Beaumont Hamel, through Achiet-le-Grand
to Bapaume, or the one from Peronne
through Le Transloy.</div>

</div>

<p>It was in December 1916 that I paid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
my first visit to the valley of the Somme.
The scene was dreary beyond description.
Many villages known to us by name as the
scenes of desperate fighting were a name
only. Hardly a vestige of a house or
cottage remained where many had been
before the war. Here and there one could
see the entrance to a cellar; the charred
stump of a strafed tree; the remains of a
garden; or a bit of a cemetery. Everything
else was churned up into the most
appalling mud.</p>

<p>One day I had tea with an Army commander
who has done great things since
then, and he showed me a series of photographs&mdash;the
most interesting I have ever
seen, which were taken the day before my
visit, by our airmen, over the German
lines. For seventeen and a half miles
back, the enemy, with infinite care and
patience, had constructed trenches, 'and,'
said the Commander, 'every time we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
destroy his front line trench he constructs
another one in the rear.' 'But,' I cried,
'if this kind of thing goes on, and unless
the unexpected happens, the war must
surely continue indefinitely.' His only
reply was, 'Is it not always the unexpected
that happens in war?' I was back again
in Picardy in the summer of 1917, and the
unexpected had happened. The whole
of the seventeen and a half miles of
trenches were in the hands of the British!
The enemy had retired to the much
advertised 'Hindenburg Line,' and leaving
nothing to chance, was tirelessly, ceaselessly
massing and training his men, getting
together huge reserves of munitions,
husbanding his resources in every possible
way, and preparing, always preparing day
and night for his next great move. Meanwhile,
Italy's defences had to be strengthened
by troops we could ill-afford to spare
from our Western front, and Russia, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
loyalty to whom we first entered the war,
failed us altogether, German intrigue being
the underlying cause in each case. In his
great advance in March and April 1918
he did not achieve all he set out to do by
any means, but his gains were enormous.
It makes one sad to think of the territory
we had temporarily to relinquish to the
Hun in Picardy, even though the country
itself was not of any intrinsic value.
The land is desolate, and the enemy
ruined every village and hamlet, every
farm and cottage, before his retreat.
Ninety-three Red Triangle centres&mdash;huts,
marquees, cellars, dug-outs, and 'strafed'
houses had to be abandoned in Picardy
alone&mdash;most of them destroyed before they
fell into the hands of the Germans.</p>

<p>During the first visit to the battlefields
of the Somme in the winter of 1916, the
outstanding feature of the landscape was
the mud and the general desolation. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the summer of 1917 the scenes of desolation
were as great as ever, but there was a
difference&mdash;the roads were in excellent
condition and bridges had been replaced.
There were shell-holes everywhere and the
countryside was strewn with dud shells;
barbed wire entanglements; with here and
there a stranded tank that had had to be
abandoned in the mud; the remains of
trenches and dug-outs or the cages in which
the Huns had collected their British
prisoners. There were no domestic animals
to be seen, and no civilians. The whole
district from Albert to Peronne, to Bapaume
or to Arras, was one huge cemetery, and
one saw side by side the elaborate cross
that marked the burying place of German
dead, the smaller cross with the tricolour
on it, that marked the last resting-place of
the soldier of France, and everywhere for
miles and miles could be seen the little plain
brown crosses of wood, that marked the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
spot where lay our own loved dead. We
climbed to the top of the famous Butte of
Warlincourt that so often changed hands
in the course of desperate fighting, and
there on the top were those little brown
crosses. We stood at the edge of the vast
crater of La Boiselle that inaugurated the
first battle of the Somme and saw in its
depths several of those little symbols of
our Christian faith, but looking away
across the desolation of the battlefield one
marvelled at the efforts of nature to hide
up the ravages of war. There were the
most glorious masses of colour everywhere&mdash;the
colour given by the wild
flowers of the battlefields. One felt one
had never seen more vivid blue than that
of the acres of cornflowers which rivalled
the hues of the gentian of the Alps. It
may have been imagination, but looking
out from the Butte of Warlincourt over
miles of poppies, one felt one had never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
seen such vivid red, and instinctively those
words came into one's mind:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'O Cross that liftest up my head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I dare not seek to fly from thee;</span><br />
I lay in dust life's glory dead,<br />
And from the ground there blossoms red,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Life that shall endless be.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>The wild flowers of Picardy have bloomed
over British graves again in the summer of
1918, though German, not British, eyes
saw them during the early months, but
those flowers speak of eternal hope, and
tell us that if we but do our part, the
sacrifice of our bravest and best will not
have been made in vain.</p>

<p>Amid the ruins of Picardy the Y.M.C.A.
did some of its best work. Lord Derby
spoke of the Association as 'essential in
peace time, indispensable in war time,' and
never was the Association more indispensable
than during those terrible days
of the German advance in 1918. Amid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the ever-changing scenes of war it has been
one of the forces working for reconstruction.
We mourn the loss of huts and Red
Triangle centres that have cost money, and
on which labour has been lavished. Not
much to look at many of these places,
and yet to those who knew them they
possessed an indescribable charm and
fascination. It was only a little marquee,
for instance, that formed the Headquarters
of the Red Triangle at Henin in 1917, only
a couple of padres, one Church of England
and one a Free Churchman there to
represent the Y.M.C.A., but the whole
story is a romance. Whilst we were
sharing their lunch of bully beef and
potatoes, bread, biscuits, and coffee, a
'strafe' began. The British artillery, half
a mile away, were pouring lead into the
Hun lines. Fritz soon replied, and things
became lively. A shell burst near us, but
our padres took no notice of it, and seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to regard a little incident of that kind
as a matter of course. Another shell
burst on the cross-roads we had just
traversed. It was here we had our first
glimpse of the Hindenburg Line with
Crucifix Corner in the foreground. Whilst
we were still at lunch the Germans began
to throw over some of their heavy stuff
in the direction of Monchy, which was not
far away. The British camp at Henin
had been heavily bombarded a few days
before our visit, and the troops quite properly
had to run like rabbits to their
burrows. The last to take refuge in the
dug-outs were our two padres, who with a
keen and commendable sense of duty had
waited to gather up the cash before taking
refuge from the shells. One of the leaders
gives the following graphic story of his
experiences in the Retreat:&mdash;</p>

<p>'On the first day of the offensive we
were wakened by terrific drum fire to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
north, but on our own immediate stretch
of front, the firing was not so severe. There
was therefore no immediate need for
evacuation. During that day the hut
work went on as usual, but few men
appeared, as everybody was "standing to."
Liquid nourishment of the Y.M.C.A. type
was rather at a discount. We finished
serving at a somewhat late hour, and
deemed it advisable to sleep in the dug-out,
as a few shells had begun to sing overhead.
Early the next morning we were awakened
by the sound of many men on the move.
More and still more French troops were
arriving, and that day we had to speak
more French than English. Towards evening
uncomfortable reports began to arrive
that the Germans had several places
behind us, some in the immediate rear.
"Les avions Boche," about which the
Frenchmen were using "polite" phrases
all day, were continually overhead, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
having reported the movement of troops
on the roads, shell-fire began to increase
in intensity. Decidedly, it was "getting
warm." Lieutenant-Colonel &mdash;&mdash; of the
R.A.M.C. and the Medical Staff with whom
I had had the privilege of messing for some
time were very forcible in their advice to
me to evacuate with the orderlies. They
were living in a shell-proof dug-out,
whereas we had no possible defence against
a direct hit from any kind of shell.</p>

<p>'Several batteries of artillery having
been withdrawn from forward positions,
and posted near us, were making sleep
impossible and drawing the enemy's fire.
It was quite impossible to obtain transport
of any kind for my stores, so I gave what
remained to the R.A.M.C. for walking
wounded cases, of which I had supplied
several during the day.</p>

<p>'Then we made a "night-flitting," the
orderlies and myself, and slept a few miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to the S.W. But with every step away
from the hut I became more and more
uncomfortable. By daybreak I had decided
to return and see how things were
going. The orderlies decided to accompany
me.</p>

<p>'On the way back we had to take cover
once for a while, but finally reached the
hut and carried on for the remainder of
the day.</p>

<p>'We were called several kinds of lunatics
for returning by the Medical Staff, who were
then preparing to leave, and be it confessed
we felt the truth of their remarks. It was
quite out of the question to hold on any
longer without cover save a "tin-hat"
a-piece, so again we evacuated, this time
finally.'</p>

<p>It was only when the grey-clad Germans
were actually in sight that the workers at
St. Leger left their loved Y.M.C.A. I only
visited St. Leger once, but that little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
shanty strangely fascinated me. It was
not much to look at, just a group of ruined
farm buildings, and in it 'the swallows
had found a house' and regardless of our
presence, yes, regardless of the shells, for
St. Leger was bombarded every day even
then, they flew backwards and forwards,
feeding their young and twittering merrily
and unconcernedly as if it had been a farm
building in one of our English counties.
It must have been with a heavy heart that
those Y.M.C.A. men turned their backs on
St. Leger and trudged to Boisleaux-au-Mont,
where the five splendid huts that
formed our equipment shortly afterwards
shared the fate of St. Leger, and were all
destroyed before the advance of the Huns.</p>

<p>At Boyelles the tent was amid the ruins
by the roadside, and the enamelled Triangle
sign was attached to the bottom of the
trunk of a tree that had been cut down by
the enemy and was lying in the hedge just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
as it fell. Achiet-le-Petit Y.M.C.A. was
in an orchard, the equipment consisting
of a big marquee and several little shanties
ingeniously constructed by the workers
from empty petrol cans and biscuit boxes.
High up in an elm tree was a sort of crow's
nest, used by the Germans as an observation
post during the time of their occupation.
At Haplincourt the Y.M.C.A. was
anything but imposing&mdash;an insignificant
house fitted up as a club room, but in the
paddock behind it the secretaries had
erected a platform, and arranged an open-air
auditorium on a grand scale. A
hundred yards or so away was a large
plunge bath, deep enough for a good high
dive. It had been constructed by the
Germans when they were in occupation,
but when we saw it a score of our own
Tommies were disporting themselves in
the water and having a high old time.
Albert was a scene of desolation, with its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
ruined church as the most conspicuous
feature. High up on the top of the spire,
dislodged by German shells, and jutting
out at right angles to the spire, was the
famous figure of the Virgin holding in her
hands the infant Christ. For many months
the figure had remained in this position, and
was only finally brought down during the
enemy's advance in 1918. The Y.M.C.A.
in Albert was established in one big hut
and two badly ruined houses. It was on
the Saturday that St. Leger fell, and the
Sunday at Albert was a memorable day.
The town was crowded with an endless
stream of men, horses, guns, and service
wagons passing through. Little was sold
in our canteens, but free refreshments were
handed out by tired but willing workers
all day long. Nearly all those workers
had thrilling stories to tell of narrow
escapes from death. Albert was evacuated
on the Sunday night, and the place must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
have presented somewhat the appearance
of a shambles. The Boche aeroplanes were
dropping bombs or firing their machine-guns
all the time, but still our men kept
on serving the hot tea and cocoa, biscuits,
and cigarettes that were so much appreciated
by officers and men alike, only
leaving their posts and abandoning their
hut when ordered to do so by the Military.
The retreat from Albert must have been
like an awful nightmare. Some of our men
in the darkness became entangled in the
fallen wires, and whilst trying to extricate
themselves heard the hum of an aeroplane
just overhead, and a bomb was dropped
only a few yards in front of them.</p>

<span class="caption">THE Y.M.C.A. IN A RUINED WAREHOUSE. SHELL-HOLE IN FLOOR OF CANTEEN</span>
</div>

<p>At Bapaume we had several centres
in and closely adjacent to the town.
Bapaume, like Peronne, was not destroyed
by enemy shell-fire, but deliberately
wrecked by the Hun before he was forced
to evacuate, and the foe we face to-day is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a past master in the art of destruction.
Hardly a building of any description
remained intact in either of these towns
when the British entered into occupation.
That very fact made us marvel when,
standing for the first time in front of the
big building occupied by the Y.M.C.A. in
Peronne we noticed that it was practically
intact. On entering the building we
marvelled still more, for the first object
we saw was a fine German piano. Surely
it was an act of kindness on the part of
the wily Hun to leave it for our men.
Was it? When the British occupied
Peronne a company of troops from the
west of England were the first to enter that
house. A Tommy who was musical made
a bee-line for the piano, but his officer
restrained him, bidding him first look
inside. It was well he did so, for three
powerful bombs were attached to the
strings of the piano, and had he touched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
one of the keys concerned, he himself, the
piano, and the building would have been
utterly destroyed. In the hut attached
to the house a boxing match was taking
place on the evening of our arrival, and
men had come from outposts miles away
to take part. Underneath the house was
a German dug-out of almost incredible
depth. The original staircase was missing&mdash;the
Germans having commandeered the
wood for the construction of the dug-out&mdash;but
it had been replaced by an ingenious
Y.M.C.A. secretary, who had searched
amid the ruins of Peronne until at last he
had found another staircase, which, with
infinite pains and labour and not a little
ingenuity, he had built in to replace the
original one. The day before our visit the
old lady who had lived in the house before
the war paid a visit to her old home. She
was a refugee, and had trudged miles to
get back to Peronne. She requested permission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to dig in the garden and soon
unearthed the uniform of her husband who
fought against the Germans in 1870. She
had buried it there before the fall of the
town. Digging again she came across his
sword and accoutrements, and deeper still,
her silver spoons and other trinkets that
she valued. Could anything bring home
more clearly the horrors of war? If,
instead of Peronne in Northern France, it
had been that sweet little town in England
or Scotland, or that village in Wales or
Ireland in which you live! If you had
heard the cry one evening, 'The Huns are
coming,' and had just half an hour in
which to rush round your home and gather
together any things you specially treasured,
and take them out into your garden and
bury them, knowing that anything you
left behind would be either looted and
sent to Germany, or deliberately destroyed
for sheer hate! How easily this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
might have been, but for the mercy of
God, the mistakes and miscalculations of
the enemy, and the bravery and self-sacrifice
of our heroes in blue and khaki,
yes, and our workers in fustian and print&mdash;for
England must never forget the debt
she owes to her munition workers as well
as to her sailors, soldiers, and airmen.
They see nothing of the romance of war;
they know nothing of its excitement, and
yet apart from their patriotic service the
best efforts of our fighting men would have
been in vain.</p>

<span class="caption">A Y.M.C.A. CELLAR AT YPRES</span>
</div>

<p>Never was the Y.M.C.A. more appreciated
than during the months that preceded
the great retreat in the spring of
1918. New Red Triangle huts were springing
up like mushrooms, especially in the
Fifth Army area, that part of the line that
had recently been taken over from the
French. Supported by the generous gifts
of friends at home, ably directed by our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
divisional secretaries and those associated
with them in the work, and supported and
encouraged in every way by the Military
Authorities, the progress made was remarkable.
Then came the unexpected advance of
the German hordes and the laborious work
of months was destroyed in a few hours.
At Noyon the secretary had to quit in a
hurry, but returned to the hut later to
bring away the money belonging to the
Y.M.C.A. Thrice he returned, and the
third time found it impossible to get away.
After remaining in hiding for twenty-four
hours he at length managed to escape with
ten thousand francs in his pocket, saved
for the Association which lost so heavily
during those terrible days. At Amiens the
Y.M.C.A. workers hung on for ten days
after the official canteens had been removed
because the town had become too hot for
them. Day and night the 'Joy' hut close
to the railway station was kept open, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
thronged with officers and men, and the
service rendered to the troops may be
gauged from the amount of the takings,
which ranged between fifteen and twenty-thousand
francs a day.</p>

<p>Our total loss in the retreat was exceedingly
heavy&mdash;more than one hundred and
thirty huts and other centres in Picardy
and Flanders, and in cash, upwards of
one hundred and fifty thousand pounds.
Serious as was that loss it might have been
very much worse. Eight trucks of stores
and equipment were stopped in the nick
of time. The axle of one of our big
lorries broke within a hundred yards of
the most heavily shelled area in one of the
towns bombarded by the enemy, but it
was got away and, excepting in two cases,
all the money and notes from tills and
cash-boxes were removed safely before
the huts were abandoned&mdash;striking testimony
to the devotion of those in charge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
'What I think impressed me most,' wrote
the organising secretary for France, 'has
been the undaunted spirit of our workers,
who, when shelled out of huts, persisted
in the attempt to return to them under
very great personal danger.' 'Although we
have lost everything that we had,' wrote
one, 'we still have hope within us, and
are trusting to get back right into the
thick of things in the very near future.'
Yet another, writing in the spirit of
Eastertide, said, 'We believe that our
work will rise in new freshness and
power out of its apparent extinction!'
'There was a singular unanimity of effort
on the part of the workers who were
isolated one from the other, and had no
opportunity of arranging a common policy.
The sale of such articles as the soldiers
needed continued in the huts up to the
last moment possible, and then, when the
danger of the hut and stores falling into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the hands of the enemy became imminent,
biscuits and cigarettes were handed out as
largely as possible to men in the neighbourhood
taking part in the fighting.
One would have thought that having done
this the workers would have considered
their own personal safety and retired,
but in several cases I found them running
stunts for walking wounded in the open,
outside the hut or in its immediate
neighbourhood, in close touch with the
medical authorities.</p>

<p>'The confusion of the retreat opened up
to our workers opportunities of service
which they gladly utilised. Last night
was a night of uncertainty. We could
not go to bed owing to the uncertainty
of the military position where our headquarters
were, and so stood on a high hill
beside an old Trappist monastery, watching
the village at the foot in flames, and trying
to ascertain the progress of the fighting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
through the darkness. Our workers even
under these circumstances seized an opportunity
of doing a very fine bit of service.
A stream of poor refugees were passing,
people of all conditions and ages, fleeing
for safety and shelter, and so at 11.30 at
night at the cross-roads, a table was set
up with a hot urn of cocoa and supplies of
biscuits, which were handed out to French
and Flemish people as they passed....</p>

<p>'I have never seen anything that has
touched me more than these streams of
all sorts and conditions of people straggling
along with their little belongings, infants
in arms, to old people who had not walked
a mile for years. It was a great opportunity
for rendering a truly Christian
service. The other day we lent one of
our large lorries for a whole day for the
purpose of carrying these people in some
degree of comfort to a place of safety.'</p>

<p>Thus by every device that resourcefulness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and experience could suggest the
workers of the Y.M.C.A. in France ministered
to the comfort of the men who were
so bravely sustaining that terrible onslaught.
The organisation of the Red
Triangle is the embodied goodwill of the
British people towards its beloved army.
An emergency like the one in the spring of
1918 was just the time when the services
of the Red Triangle were most sorely
needed by our soldiers.</p>

<p>Fortunately, all the Y.M.C.A. workers
got away safely. Sixty from the Fifth
Army took refuge at Amiens, whilst more
than eighty from the area of the Third
Army found sanctuary at Doullens.</p>

<p>A few months later, thanks to the
arrival of the Americans in France, and
the brilliant strategy of Foch and Haig;
thanks above all to the mercy of God, the
tide turned, and the Huns were once more
in full retreat. A distinguished war correspondent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
wrote his impressions of
Bapaume a day or two after it had again
been captured by the British. Said he,
'I prowled about the streets of Bapaume
through gaping walls of houses, over
piled wreckage, and found it the same old
Bapaume as when I had left it, except that
some of our huts and an officers' club, and
some Y.M.C.A. tents and shelters have
been blown to bits like everything else.'
A ruined town without a Y.M.C.A.!
Could anything be more desolate?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE BARRAGE AND AFTER</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>The problem of dealing with conditions, at such a
time, and under existing circumstances, at the rest
camps has always been a most difficult one; but
the erection of huts by the Young Men's Christian
Association has made this far easier.

<p>The extra comfort thereby afforded to the men,
and the opportunities for reading and writing, have
been of incalculable service, and I wish to tender
to your Association, and all those who have assisted,
my most grateful thanks.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Field-Marshal
Viscount French.</span></p></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> was on the afternoon of July 30, 1917,
that we reached Bailleul in Flanders.
Proceeding directly to the Headquarters
of the Y.M.C.A. we had tea, and then set
out to visit the huts in the vicinity. It
was a novel experience, for every hut was
empty. The reason was not far to find.
The troops were in their camps formed up
in marching order, and later in the evening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
we watched them march out to take part
in the great offensive. We were told that
the barrage was timed for 3.50 in the
morning, and were asked to have our work
for the walking wounded ready at 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
so we determined to spend the night on the
top of Kemmel Hill, the highest hill in
Flanders. It was just after midnight when
we reached the summit of the hill; and
we wondered if the barrage had not already
commenced, so heavy was the firing.
From our point of vantage we could
see the whole of the sector, from Armenti&egrave;res
in the south, across the battlefields
of Messines and Wytschaete and away
beyond Ypres in the north. Silently, close
to us, an observation balloon stole up in
the darkness, and a few minutes later
as silently descended. Involuntarily we
ducked as a monster shell shrieked overhead,
and some one cried, 'There goes the
Bailleul Express!' About 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
began to quiet down. Our guns might
have been knocked out; they were hardly
replying at all to the enemy's fire. Later
on we saw a series of signal flashes high up
across the battlefield, and then at 3.50
promptly to the moment, the barrage
began, and there was no possibility of
mistaking it&mdash;two thousand guns, as we
learned afterwards, all firing at the same
time. As one looked at that hell of flame
and bursting shell, one felt it was impossible
for any life to continue to exist
beneath it, and one thought of the boys,
as steady as if they had been on parade,
creeping up behind that barrage of fire.
We had seen them as they left their camp
the night before, and we saw them when
they returned&mdash;some of them&mdash;during the
two days following the barrage; not in
regiments a thousand strong, with colours
flying and bands playing, but dribbling
back one or two at a time&mdash;the walking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
wounded&mdash;and each one came in to our
little Y.M.C.A. tents attached to the clearing
stations&mdash;one was at an island in a
sea of mud, near Dickebusch huts in
Flanders. There was a queue inside of
two or three hundred men. Every man
in that queue was wounded, and waiting
to have his wounds attended to; every
man was hungry until he entered that
tent; every man plastered from head to
foot with the most appalling mud, and
unless one has seen the mud of Flanders or
of the Somme, it is impossible to imagine
what it is really like. As I mingled with
the men in that queue and assisted our
workers to hand out hot tea, coffee, and
cocoa, biscuits, bread and butter, chocolate,
cigarettes or oranges, I thanked God for
the opportunity He had given to the
Y.M.C.A., and the thing that impressed
me more than anything else was the fact
that one did not hear a single complaint,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
not one word of grousing. And why not?
Was it because they liked that kind of
thing? Don't make any mistake about
it&mdash;no one could possibly like it, but out
there the men know they are fighting not
for truth and freedom in the abstract, but
for their own liberty, and, what is infinitely
more important to them, for their homes
and loved ones. They know that what
the Hun has done for Northern France
and Flanders is as nothing compared with
what he would do for the places and the
people we love if he once got the opportunity
of wreaking his vengeance on us.
There is no finer bit of work that the
Y.M.C.A. is doing to-day than this work
for the walking wounded, which before any
great push takes place, is carefully organised
down to the last detail. Before one of the
great battles, our men took up their
positions at thirty-four different centres
where they were able to minister to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
needs of the wounded, and thus to co-operate
with the magnificent work that is
being done under the sign of the Red Cross.
As in France, so in Italy and in the East,
at Beersheba and other centres on the lines
of communication in Palestine, records show
how efficiently the same type of service is
being rendered to our brave troops.</div>

<p>To return to the barrage. It is always
interesting to note the effect a scene of
that kind has on people of different
temperaments. We had been sitting round
a huge shell-hole near the top of Kemmel
Hill feeling, it must be confessed, a trifle
'fed-up' with things. We were all tired,
and had had a very heavy day's work.
It was an uncomfortable night, to say the
least of it, with drizzling rain, and very
cold for the time of year. At the first
sound of the drum-fire of the barrage
set up by the British guns, we sprang to our
feet, wild with excitement. A distinguished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
padre from the Midlands was lost in admiration
for the work of the munitioners
whose labours made possible this great
strafing of the Hun. The leader of the
party, a colonial from far-off Australia,
simply danced with excitement which he
made no attempt to suppress, contenting
himself with ejaculating from time to
time expressions to the effect that that
was the most dramatic moment of his life.
An unemotional Professor from one of our
great universities stood with clenched
fists, and was overheard to say, 'Give 'em
hell, boys!' Another padre in the
company began to quote Browning, the
quotation referring to the signal flashes
to which reference has already been made:</p>

<p>How often it happens that in the
greatest moments of one's life, it is the
trivial thing that appeals most strongly to
one's imagination. So in this case. The
thing never to be forgotten was connected
with the early dawn. I can see even now
that long grey streak on the horizon across
the battlefield, as the daylight came. A
thrush from a bush close to where we were
standing began to pour out its song of praise
and thanksgiving, heedless of falling shells
and the roar of guns. There was something
unspeakably pathetic in that song on the
battlefield, yes, and prophetic of the great
day that is coming in spite of all reverses; the
day of victory and peace, peace purchased
at the price of struggle, and of blood.</p>

<p>As one watched the barrage from
Kemmel the onslaught seemed to be
irresistible. It seemed impossible for the
German hordes to hold our men back.
Neither could they have held them, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
what the Hun could not do, the rain did
for him. It just teemed down, and in a
few hours Flanders was churned up into
a swamp of mud. It was impossible to
bring the big guns up and the whole
advance was stayed. One thought how
often the same thing had happened before,
and wondered, only wondered, if we at
home were supporting the boys at the
Front as they had a right to expect us to
support them? It is so easy at a time
like this to put one's trust merely in
'reeking tube and iron shard,' and to
leave God out of our calculations. After
all in this great struggle we are not fighting
merely against 'flesh and blood,' but
against 'principalities and powers, against
spiritual wickedness in high places,' and
even to-day 'More things are wrought
by prayer than this world dreams of.'
It was that great soldier, Sir William
Robertson, who said, 'Let us never forget<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
in all that we do that the measure of our
ultimate success will be governed largely,
if not mainly, by the extent to which we
put our religious convictions into our
actions, and hold fast, firmly and fearlessly,
to the faith of our forefathers.' Had the
Germans beaten us two years ago every
one would have known the reason why&mdash;they
had more men, bigger guns, and
more of them, more aeroplanes, and an
infinitely better supply of munitions of
war, but by the summer of 1917 we were
superior to them in every particular, and yet
victory tarried. Why? Can it be that God
was waiting for His people to seek His aid?</p>

<p>With Russia out of the war, we were
once again to stand with our backs to the
wall&mdash;the position in which the British
are always seen at their best&mdash;and the
National crisis came as one more challenge
to the Nation to turn to the God of our
fathers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>'LES PARENTS BLESS&Eacute;ES'</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>The Y.M.C.A.? Why, they could no more do
without the Y.M.C.A. than they could do without
munitions at the Front? I have seen it in operation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The
Right Hon. Will Crooks, M.P.</span></div>


<div class='unindent'>'<span class="smcap">A Great</span> Mother Hen,' so wrote one who
for the first time saw the work of the
Y.M.C.A. for the relatives of dangerously
wounded men. This work is carried on in
London and a number of provincial
centres, but it is seen at its best in France,
for there it is on a much larger scale.
If a man is dangerously wounded and
lying in one of the hospitals on the other
side of the Channel, a message is sent to his
people at home containing the requisite
permission to visit him, and telling them,
moreover, that from the moment they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
reach France the Y.M.C.A. will take care
of them. Red Triangle motors meet every
boat as it reaches a French port; automatically
the relatives of wounded, or
'Les Parents Bless&eacute;es' as the French call
them, are handed over to our care, and
we motor them to their destination&mdash;assisted
sometimes by the Red Cross. As
this may mean a run of eighty or a hundred
miles, and in war time may mean a whole
day, or possibly two days on the French
railways, the motor run is in itself a great
boon. During the whole of the time they
are in France, the relatives are entertained
as the guests of the Red Triangle in the
special hostels that have been established
for the purpose in the principal bases.
Many of them have never been away from
their own homes before; they know no
language but their own, and a journey
of the kind would have its terrors at any
time, but to all the ordinary difficulties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
has now to be added the fact that they
are consumed with anxiety on account
of those who are dearer than life itself.
It means everything to them that the
Y.M.C.A. as a 'Great Mother Hen' takes
them under its protection, soothes and
protects them, so that in the darkest
moments of their lives they are not dealt
with by any officials who have to get
through so many cases in a given time,
but by sympathetic friends, actuated only
by the love of God, and of country. One
of the most beautiful of these hostels is
'Les Iris.' It is hidden away in the
depths of a wood near the sea, and in the
springtime the nights are full of the melody
of the nightingales. This hostel is reserved
largely for the use of the relatives of
dangerously wounded officers. The lady
who presides over another of the hostels
has been called the Florence Nightingale
of the Red Triangle, and indeed that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
would be a suitable name for any of these
ladies who take the relatives to their
hearts, and do everything possible to
comfort and cheer them and make them
feel at home. As we write, a letter from
one of our guests lies before us. We quote
from it because it is typical of thousands
of letters received from grateful friends:&mdash;</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Many thanks for the photo of my
son's grave received this morning.
How very kind you Y.M.C.A. people
are. I little thought last November
when I was begging (Hut Week in
Brighton) that I should reap personal
benefit from the Y.M.C.A. The kindness
and hospitality extended to my
husband and I when we came to France
nearly three months ago, we shall never
forget. It is not in our power to help
with money except in a small way,
but we tell all we can, and help in every
way in our power.'</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>During a recent visit to France we had
the privilege of being shown over one of
the British hospitals, which, like all our
hospitals, was wonderfully efficient. Everything
that could be done to alleviate
suffering was done. In one ward every
man was seriously wounded, and side by
side were two beds, one occupied by a
young Canadian and the other by a young
Britisher. The latter had his mother with
him, who was one of our guests. The
Canadian watched them together for some
time in silence, but followed them with
his eyes as a cat might a mouse. Suddenly,
without any warning, he flung himself
over on to his side and burst out crying.
Questioned as to what was the matter, he
replied, 'Nothing.' 'Then what makes
you cry? Is the pain worse?' 'No,
thanks, the pain is better.' 'Then what
makes you cry like that?' Drying his
eyes, the boy replied, 'It's all very well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
for him, he's got his mother with him.
My mother is more than six thousand
miles away!' Is it not worth any effort
and any cost to help the loved ones of
these men who have made such great
sacrifices for us? The whole of this work
for 'Les Parents Bless&eacute;es' is full of pathos.
On one occasion we reached a big hospital
centre just as another Association car
arrived from a big base port, bringing
three English women to see their husbands.
The Y.M.C.A. leader took them to the
wards they were seeking. At the first,
the sister in charge came to speak to one
of our guests and said, 'I am very sorry,
but am afraid your husband won't know
you. He has been terribly ill, and all sorts
of complications have set in, but you had
better come in and see him.' Twenty
minutes later we saw her again, and she
told us that for ten minutes she sat by
her husband's bedside, but he did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
know her. Then stooping over him, she
whispered, 'You remember little Lizzie
and little Willie at home, don't you?'
For one second he gave her that look of
love and recognition that made the long
journey from home worth while.</p>

<p>Passing on to another ward we sent in a
message, and the sister came to greet our
guest, and said, 'I am glad to say your
husband is much better. I'll tell him you
are here.' When she <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'same'">came</ins> back she said
she had asked the invalid, 'What would
you like best in all the world?' Without
a moment's hesitation, he replied, 'To
go back to Blighty, Sister.' 'Blighty'&mdash;how
many of those who use it realise the
meaning of the word? It comes from the
Indian 'Vilayhti' and means 'The home
across the sea.' 'Blighty!' said the Sister;
'you know that's impossible. What
would you like next best?' 'To see my
wife,' was the prompt reply. 'And what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
would you say if I told you your wife was
waiting outside to see you?' queried the
Sister, as she moved from his bedside and
opened the door. Yes, to these people
many thousands of them, the Red Triangle
has indeed been as a Great Mother Hen at
a time when they most needed its care.
We are all very much like big children,
and to all of us there are times when we
need some one to take us by the hand and
speak words of consolation and good
cheer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>CELLARS AND DUG-OUTS ON THE WESTERN FRONT</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>My son, who is somewhere in France, tells me what
a great comfort your Y.M.C.A. has been to him
from the time he started his training at &mdash;&mdash; and
all through his stopping-places almost up to the
trenches.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Unless</span> one has seen for oneself the ravages
of war, it is impossible to conceive the
horror and desolation of a place like Ypres.
Before the war it was one of the most
beautiful cities in Europe, to-day it is
nothing more than a heap of ruins. It
is enough to make even the most unemotional
of men cry, to stand in that
once beautiful Cloth Hall Square and see
how complete is the destruction&mdash;not one
house, not a single room left intact&mdash;everything
destroyed beyond recognition. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
what of the Y.M.C.A. in Ypres? There
we found the Red Triangle standing erect
amid the ruins, and following the hand
that pointed down we came to a little
cellar Y.M.C.A.&mdash;only a cellar and yet it
had been a source of helpfulness and
inspiration to tens of thousands of our
brave men. It was wonderfully fitted up,
contained a small circulating library, piano,
and everything needed for the canteen
side of things. Not only that, it was a
centre to work from. Between the cellar
and the enemy were nine dug-outs at
advanced stations. As these were all
evacuated by order of the Military during
the German offensive in April 1918, there
can be no objection to their location being
indicated. The first consisted of a ruined
house and a Nissen hut at the Asylum;
the second was at 'Salvation Corner,' and
the third at Dead End, on the Canal bank.
There was a Y.M.C.A. at Wells Cross<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Roads, another at St. Jean and Wiel, and
a sixth at Potyze Ch&acirc;teau. The seventh
had a homely ring about it, for it was
situated at 'Oxford Circus,' the eighth
was at St. Julien, the ninth at Lille Gate
(Ypres), and the tenth was the cellar
Y.M.C.A. at the corner of Lille Road
referred to above. For many months it
was the centre of the social life of the
stricken town, but in August 1917 it
received a direct hit from an enemy shell,
and was knocked in. This dug-out work
is intensely interesting, though naturally
it has its limitations. Large meetings are,
of course, impossible; sometimes even the
singing of a hymn would be sufficient to
attract the attention of Fritz, but the man
who is resourceful and courageous, and who
can see an opportunity for Christian
service in meeting the common everyday
needs of men, will find endless opportunities
of putting in a word for the Master&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the sordid dug-out under shell-fire, can
easily be transformed into a temple to
His praise, an inquiry-room where resolutions
are made that change the lives of
men, and help the soldier to realise that he
is called to be a crusader.</div>

</div>

<p>In the Red Triangle dug-outs of the
Ypres salient, from three to four thousand
bloaters were supplied to the troops
week by week; 1500 kilos of apples, and
more than 100,000 eggs! It was a miracle
how these latter were collected in the
villages behind the line. Corps provided
a lorry and two drivers for five months to
bring them into Ypres, and also assisted
us with thirty orderlies. It was that
timely help that made our work possible.
It would be difficult to overestimate the
boon to the troops of this variety to their
diet. Iron rations will keep body and
soul together, but it is the little extra
that helps so much in keeping up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
health and spirits of the men. They would
follow the egg lorry for a mile and gladly
pay the threepence each that the eggs cost.
In February 1918, the turnover from the
Red Triangle centres round Ypres amounted
to 245,000 francs, whilst in March it had
risen to 260,000. For many weeks in this
salient we gave away from five to six thousand
gallons of hot drinks each week. All
honour to the band of Y.M.C.A. leaders
who kept the Red Triangle flag flying under
these difficult conditions. For six weeks
one of our leaders was unable to leave his
cellar home, owing to the incessant shelling
and bombing of the immediate vicinity.
These were men who 'counted not their own
lives dear unto them,' but were ready to
take any risk and to put up with any personal
inconvenience that they might serve
the country they loved&mdash;yes, and they too
endured 'as seeing Him Who is invisible.'</p>

<p>The King, who is the patron of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Y.M.C.A., and very keenly interested in the
work, visited our tiny centre at Messines.
The dug-out at Wytschaete was knocked
out, and the Red Triangle cellar at Meroc,
just behind Loos, destroyed by a direct
hit. The latter was approached by a long
communication trench, and was fitted up
in the ordinary way&mdash;a few tables and
chairs, reading and writing materials, games,
pictures on the walls, and, of course, the
inevitable and always appreciated piano.
A few days before we were there a dud
shell from one of the German 'heavies'
fell only two or three yards in front of the
divisional secretary's car. The cellar was
immediately under a ruined <i>brasserie</i>, and
in the grounds of the latter was a solitary
German grave. The story goes that in
the early days of the war enemy patrols
passed through Meroc, and a shot alleged
to have been fired from a window of the
<i>brasserie</i> found its billet in one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Huns. In revenge, the Germans killed
every man, woman, and child in the
<i>brasserie</i>. In striking contrast was the
story told us by the matron of one of our
British hospitals: 'Every one in this ward
is desperately wounded, and too ill to
travel. All in that row,' said she, pointing,
'are Germans. Yesterday a man occupying
one of those beds lay dying, and could
not make his head comfortable. I went
into the next ward, and said to the Tommies
"There's a German dying, will one of you
lend him your pillow?" Without a
moment's hesitation,' said she, 'every one
of those dangerously wounded Britishers
whipped out his pillow to help his dying
enemy.' That is the spirit of our men,
and that accounts, quite as much as their
valour, for the fact that they have won the
respect even of an enemy trained from
infancy to regard the British soldier as an
object of scorn and derision.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>CAMEOS FROM FRANCE</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>The work of this Young Men's Christian Association
has sunk so deep into the minds and into the
lives of our fellow countrymen that its work in the
future can never be diminished, and must be extended.
And it is going to do more to my mind,
than simply minister to the wants of the men in
camp; it is going to be a bond between this country
and the Great Englands beyond the sea.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Rt.
Hon. the Earl of Derby, K.G., G.C.V.O.</span></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A striking</span> feature of the war work of the
Y.M.C.A. has been the promptness with
which a new situation has been seized and
a new opening entered. There has been
an utter absence of red tape, and freedom
of action has been given to all accredited
representatives of the Association. The
Red Triangle has always been first in the
field, and has been likened to a tank in its
knack of overcoming apparently insuperable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
obstacles. The day after the British
troops first entered Bapaume a Y.M.C.A.
man appeared leading a packhorse loaded
up with cigarettes, biscuits, and dolly
cakes, which he distributed amongst the
troops. He had got a foothold for the
Association, and that foothold was retained
until Bapaume was evacuated.</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the British offensive in the early days
of August 1918 a noted war correspondent
at the Front wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'In one part of the line three hours
after the troops reached their final
objective they were eating a hot breakfast
as part of the programme of the day.
The familiar, ever-welcome sign of the
"Y.M.C.A." blossomed on a roofless
French caf&eacute; six miles within the
crumpled German line, before the
tanks had finished chasing the 11th
Corps staff out of Framerville and down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the Peronne road. Food, and even books
and papers, were set out under the Red
Triangle for tired and hungry fighting
men as they trooped into the rickety
building to eat and be refreshed in a
room carpeted with German papers.'</p></div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>What thrilling memories the name of
Arras will always conjure up in the minds
of Y.M.C.A. workers who served in that
city of ruins! One wrote home the day
after a strong attack by the British on
the enemy lines. He wrote the letter from
a dug-out which only the day before was
occupied by the Huns, in which he was
carrying on for the Y.M.C.A. So precipitate
was their flight that he partook of the repast
served up by German cooks for German
officers. At one time the rival trenches
were, in places, less than ten yards apart!
It was here that Sir Douglas Haig personally
complimented the Association on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
work its representatives were doing on the
field of battle.</p>

<p>The most memorable motor run we ever
had was from Souastre to Arras in 1916.
The hut was closed when we reached
Souastre in the morning, the leader having
received a letter from the Town Major
politely requesting him to close it from
7.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> as it was expected that the Huns
would strafe the village at 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and again
at 4.30, and so it happened. This seemed
strange, as the village had not been strafed
of late. How could the British have known
when Fritz would fire again? It seemed uncanny,
until a strange unwritten reciprocal
working arrangement between friend and
foe was explained, which means in effect
that Fritz refrains from bombing or bombarding
'A&mdash;&mdash;' three or four miles behind
the British lines if Tommy leaves village
'B&mdash;&mdash;' behind his lines alone, and <i>vice
versa</i>. As both villages are used as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
billets for the rival armies, both have been
glad at times to honour this understanding.
The run from Souastre to the railhead at
Saulty was uneventful. Night was closing
in as we left for Arras and there was no
moon. For twenty kilos or more we had
to travel with lights extinguished. We
were less than a mile from the enemy
trenches, which ran parallel to the road
we were traversing. 'Verey' lights or
star-shells sent up by the enemy continually
made everything as light as day for the
few seconds they were in the air. There
were mysterious noises from the gun
emplacements that run along the roadside,
and mysterious shapes loomed up ahead
of us from time to time as we overhauled
and passed transport wagons and the like.
At last we reached our destination, and
it was the writer's first visit to a town of
considerable size that had been wrecked
by bombardment. There were barricades<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in the streets, shell-holes and ruins everywhere.
We motored through the famous
Grande Place and passed through street
after street in that city of the dead, until,
turning a corner, we entered a narrow street
near the ruined cathedral, and hearing a
piano playing rag-time, it was obvious
that we were near the Y.M.C.A. The
memory of that old ch&acirc;teau in the narrow
street will always remain with us as we
saw it then&mdash;the entrance hall, where free
hot drinks were being dispensed; the
canteen crammed with British soldiers,
including many 'Bantams,' who were then
stationed at Arras; the little concert-room,
with possibly a hundred men gathered
round a piano singing choruses and snatches
of songs or listening to the rag-time,
accompanying it at times by whistling the
refrain or stamping on the floor. Another
crowd upstairs had been entertained to a
lantern lecture, and the day's programme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
was being concluded with family prayers.
As we lay awake that night we heard many
familiar noises that sounded strange there&mdash;a
cat call, the cry of a baby, whilst ever
and anon a shell would go shrieking over
the town. In the morning we visited the
ruined cathedral, which was a sight to
make men or angels weep, but even there
one saw erect amid the ruins, at the
highest point, the Cross, the emblem of our
Christian faith, and one knew that though
it might be by way of the Cross, yet truth
and freedom would triumph in the end.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A well-known war correspondent writing
from British Headquarters in France to
the <i>Daily Mail</i>, on August 13, 1918, told
the story of a village under shell-fire and
still within reach of machine-gun bullets,
in which was a German notice-board
pointing to an incinerator, and wrote:&mdash;'I
hear from an officer who visited the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
spot again a day later that another notice,
"This way to the Y.M.C.A." was added.
A dashing cavalry officer, very much of
the old school, possessing a voice that
would carry two miles, begged me with
great earnestness to do him one service,
"Would I mention the Y.M.C.A.? It had
provided his men with hot coffee before
riding out."' That is the kind of service
the Red Triangle has the privilege of
rendering to our fighting men in the course
of practically every battle.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Bois Carr&eacute; in 1916 was a very
unhealthy spot. At the edge of a wood in
a tiny natural amphitheatre the Y.M.C.A.
had one of its outposts. An orderly was
usually in charge, and day and night he
kept up a good supply of hot drinks for
free distribution to the troops. There

and other necessaries, or receive free of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
charge the ever-welcome writing-paper
and materials. The supervising secretary
visiting the dug-out one day in the course
of his rounds found it had been blown in
by a big shell. The orderly was terribly
wounded, part of his side having been
blown away, but smiling amid his agony,
he said, 'The money's safe here, sir!'
Careless of himself, the brave fellow's first
consideration was to safeguard the money
in the Y.M.C.A. till.</p>

<p>We have vivid recollections of our visit
to the Bois Carr&eacute; in 1916. Late in the
evening we reached Dickebusch. The
Y.M.C.A. was there in the main street of
the little Belgian village, and immediately
behind it was the ruined church. It was
only a small strafed building in a ruined
street when the Red Triangle first made
its appearance in Dickebusch, but the
secretary held that to be the most convenient
type of Y.M.C.A. building, 'for,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
said he, 'if it becomes too small, all you
have to do is to knock a hole through the
wall on either side, and take in additional
houses.' This was exactly what we had
done and, unattractive as it was, the place
drew crowds of men. At the Dickebusch
Y.M.C.A. we were provided with shrapnel
and gas helmets and instructed in the use
of the latter. A two-mile trudge across
a duck-walk over 'b&mdash;&mdash;y meadow'
brought us to the famous Ridgewood Dug-outs.
It was here that the Canadians lost
their guns in the early days of the war,
and afterwards so gloriously regained
them. We entered the wood at midnight.
A huge rat crossed our path, and as we
entered the first of the Y.M.C.A. dug-outs
where free cocoa was being dispensed in
empty jam tins, we remembered a yarn
told us the day before by one of our
workers. He had come to Ridgewood as
a special speaker, and after the evening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
meeting lay down on the floor of the dug-out
to sleep, but as he was beginning to
feel drowsy, a huge rat ran over his legs,
and later one passed across his face. With
an electric flash-lamp he scared them
away, but soon getting used to it they came
on 'in close formation.' He lit a candle,
and a few minutes later the rat ran away
with the candle&mdash;so he said! From the
Ridgewood we went on to the Bois Carr&eacute;.
Shells were screaming overhead all the
time, but it was not a long walk though it
provided many thrills. For a couple of
hundred yards we were on open ground,
and within easy reach of the Hun snipers.
Only two of us were allowed to pass at a
time, and my guide and I had to keep
fifty yards apart, and when a 'Verey'
light went up, had to stand absolutely
still until it fell to earth, and its light was
extinguished. Weird things those star
shells! They shoot up to a good height<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
like rockets, burst into brilliant light,
poise in mid-air and gradually shimmer
down and out. A few minutes brought us
to the shelter of a ruined <i>brasserie</i>, and
from its further side we entered the
communication trenches, and thus passed
to the Bois Carr&eacute;. Standing back to
visualise the scene, the orderly caught my
arm and pulled me into the shelter of the
dug-out&mdash;a second later came the patter
of machine bullets on the sand-bags where
we had stood not ten seconds before.
There was something fascinating about
that little dug-out Y.M.C.A., with its
caterer's boiler, urns and stores, and it is
sad to think that since then it has been
destroyed by shell-fire, even though other
dug-outs have been opened to take its
place.</p>

<p>A year later we revisited that old

The central hall remained, and the Red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Triangle was on it, marking it out as a centre
for walking wounded. A dressing station
had been rigged up in the cellar underneath.
A distinguished preacher serving
with the Y.M.C.A. conducted a memorable
Watch-night service in the Ridgewood.
Two or three hundred men gathered round
and listened with marked attention. A
shell burst quite close during the prayer,
and every man instinctively glanced up
to see the effect on the padre. He carried
on exactly as if nothing had happened, and
won his way to every heart.</p>

<h3>STORIES OF 'LE TRIANGLE ROUGE'</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>It is with very great pleasure I send a small
contribution (3s.) to the Y.M.C.A. funds, and only
wish it could match my inclination. Few things
have brought so much comfort to the parents at
home as the knowledge of the splendid work done
by your organisation. As one boy puts it, 'When
we get inside the Y.M.C.A. hut, we feel as if we are
home again.'</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>At</span> the close of a Y.M.C.A. Conference held
in the H&ocirc;tel McMahon in Paris, a French
lady came timidly forward with a lovely
bouquet of red roses, and in a pretty little
speech presented them as a thankoffering
for the war work of the Y.M.C.A. It was
the gift of a mother who had four sons
serving with the Army. Those flowers
have long since faded, but the kind thought
that prompted them will always remain a
gracious memory.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A soldier home on leave brought an interesting
souvenir of the first 'Threapwood'
hut, which did such good work in the
Ploegsteert Woods, but was ultimately
destroyed by shell-fire&mdash;a 2 franc and a
50 centimes piece which had become
welded together in the heat of the conflagration.
Another Tommy saw a fierce
fight take place between British and
Germans, actually inside the hut at Neuve
&Eacute;glise. The incident that seemed to have
appealed most strongly to his imagination
was the fact that the pictures were still
hanging on the walls. It is interesting to
notice the curious freaks of dud shells.
Outside the hut at Tilloy we saw one which
had pierced its way through the trunk of a
tree without exploding&mdash;the nose of the
shell protruded at the other side of the
trunk, the shell itself remaining firmly
embedded in the tree.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>An Australian officer one day sauntered
into the 'Crystal Palace,' an important
Y.M.C.A. centre in Havre. He was interested,
and well he might be. It is a huge
building, and swarms of men assemble there
in the evenings. The Australian's interest
took a practical form. Before leaving he
handed two one-pound notes to the leader,
expressing regret that he could not make
it more, and adding, 'I think you Y.M.C.A.
people will make a religious man of me
before the war is over.' 'What do you
mean?' said the secretary. 'Well,' said
he, 'I have never had any use for religion,
but at the battle of &mdash;&mdash; I felt down and
out. I didn't care much if the Boche killed
me. I had had nothing to eat for days&mdash;when
suddenly a Y.M.C.A. man appeared,
heaven knows where he came from, but
he was there right enough, and he handed
me a good hot drink, a packet of biscuits,
and some cigarettes. Yes,' said he, 'I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
believe you Y.M.C.A. men will make a
religious man of me before you have
finished.'</p>

<p>In war-time people often forget their
differences, and in Paris one of our splendid
British soldiers, who was a Roman Catholic,
lay badly wounded and terribly ill. He
wanted to confess, but there was no English
priest near. Ultimately a French priest
confessed and absolved him through an
American Y.M.C.A. lady&mdash;a Protestant&mdash;who
acted as interpreter.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the early days of the war a valued
worker on Salisbury Plain was the grandson
of a famous Cornish revivalist. He was
an ordained man and a very strong
Protestant. He went out to France later
on as a chaplain of the United Board.
Returning home on furlough, he called at
Headquarters and told his experiences on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the battlefield. 'You will be surprised,'
said he, 'when I tell you that my greatest
friend in Flanders was a Roman Catholic
padre. He was one of the best men I ever
knew, and we had an excellent working
arrangement. On the battlefield if I came
across any of his men, I would hand them
on to him, and he would pass my men on
to me. If he were not at hand, I would try
my best to help the dying Roman Catholic
soldier as I thought my friend would have
helped him had he been there, and <i>vice
versa</i>. I shall never forget,' said he, 'my
last night in Flanders and our affectionate
farewell. You know how strong a
Protestant I have always been, and my
convictions have never been stronger than
they are to-day, but see this,'&mdash;and he
unbuttoned his tunic and brought out a
Crucifix which was hanging from his neck&mdash;'this
was the parting gift of my Roman
Catholic friend, and as long as I live I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
keep it as one of my most treasured
possessions.'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>As a rule there is not much romance in
the story of a department that concerns
itself with nothing but trading. But the
story of the growth and development of
the trading department of the Red Triangle
is a romance. All along we have discouraged
trading for trading's sake in our huts,
but in a crisis like the one brought about
by the war, it is not for each individual
or organisation to pick and choose, but to
do what is needed by the State, and on that
principle we have had to develop the
trading side of our work enormously.
Home and overseas, the department has
been brilliantly led by men animated with
the highest ideals of Christian service,
who have been ready to take any risks, and
whenever necessary to work day and
night. Their task has been colossal and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
they have done magnificently. During
the six months ending 31st May 1915, our
turnover in France amounted to &pound;32,594,
whilst three years later the six months
turnover had risen to &pound;680,000. It was
thrilling work during the German advance
in March 1918, chasing our ever-moving
centres in the Somme area, and keeping
up their supplies or maintaining touch with
Amiens during these terrible days, when
for a whole week more than &pound;600 daily was
taken in the little 'Joy' hut outside the
Central Station. That meant day and
night work at our Base Stores in France,
and thanks to the cordial co-operation of the
A.M.F.O. and the H.Q.L. of C. we were
able to send forward 200 trucks from one
port alone, containing 45,000 cases, or 1,500
tons of food-stuffs, smokes, and ingredients
for hot drinks&mdash;tea, coffee, and cocoa.
From December 1914 to the middle of
May 1918&mdash;1,350,000 cases were handled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
by our stores in France, representing the
double handling of 50,500 tons of goods.
During the retreat the Y.M.C.A. motor
lorries became mobile centres of operation.
They were filled up at the nearest stores
available, and often travelled from eighty
to ninety miles to a cross roads or convenient
point where men going in and
coming out of the line were provided
with the necessary supplies. For the six
months ending November 30, 1917, our
free gifts to the troops in France amounted
to &pound;157,000. This figure does not include
the cost of huts and equipment, nor yet
the general expenditure on the work&mdash;but
it embraces the cost of the hostels for the
relatives of wounded, and free food and
drink for the walking wounded and for the
men serving in advanced positions.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A distinguished officer of the Danish
Army called at the headquarters of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
British Y.M.C.A. after a visit to France,
to acquaint himself with the history of
our war work:&mdash;'One day I stood on
Messines Ridge,' said he, 'and all around
me was devastation caused by war, shells
were to be seen bursting all around, accompanied
by the deafening roar of the big
guns. Overhead amidst the din could be
heard the whirr of the engines of the
German and Allied fighting machines.
I felt thrilled to think I was in the midst
of the greatest battle of history. Stepping
aside a few yards I was surprised to find
a dug-out with the Red Triangle sign. I
could only exclaim, "What, these people
here!"'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>One of the funniest sights we saw in
France was that of a tiny British corporal
marching behind ten stalwart German
prisoners, escorting them back to their
quarters after they had finished orderly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
duty in one of our tents. The humour
of the situation evidently appealed to
him, for he winked as he passed us&mdash;quite
an unsoldierly thing to do!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Tommy has a knack of making himself
comfortable, though his surroundings very
often do not naturally suggest comfort.
It is surprising what a snug bed and living
room combined can be made out of a discarded
hen-house! A barn occupied by
men of the Horse Guards Blue was
ingeniously rigged up by its temporary
tenants. One wall was missing and was
made up with sacking&mdash;on the other side
of this flimsy partition were the horses.
The harness was hung round the walls, and
four stakes driven into the ground for each
bed. The wire that had bound hay bales
had been ingeniously woven into wire
mattresses stretched from stake to stake;
over it was, stretched the sacking&mdash;also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
from hay bales&mdash;and over that again was
a good thick layer of straw. There is
never anything to be gained by grumbling,
but everything by taking things cheerfully
as they come and making the best of one's
circumstances.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A Y.M.C.A. hut is a poor substitute for
home, but our aim is to make every
Y.M.C.A. as much like home as it is possible
for it to be. It is surprising how much
can be done by pictures, decorations and
flowers, to give the home touch. A canary
singing over the counter; a cat on the
hearth; a bunch of primroses or forget-me-nots;
a smile or a word of welcome;
a woman's voice; a piano&mdash;family prayers
at the close of the day&mdash;these are some of
the things that count, and are numbered
amongst the greatest assets of the Red
Triangle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It is strange how often scenes and sounds
of war and peace are intermingled. It is
a common sight to see men and women
going unconcernedly about their work,
and children playing in towns that are
habitually shelled or bombed. Stranger
still is it to note the habits of the wild
birds, constructing their nest amid scenes
of war and in localities subject to constant
bombardment. The Y.M.C.A. hut in
Ploegsteert Wood was destroyed during a
three hours' bombardment in May 1916,
but whenever there came a few seconds'
pause in the booming of the guns, the
nightingales sang as unconcernedly as in
the piping times of peace. We once
heard, near Hersin, a sort of duet between
a cuckoo and a big gun; the bird punctuating
with its call the thunder of the guns,
and, as stated elsewhere, whilst the barrage
was in full swing the thrushes on Kemmel,
only a few hundred yards behind the guns,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
sang as sweetly and merrily as in the lanes
and gardens of England. In the course of a
brief visit to the American front in France
we called at a little Y.M.C.A. shanty,
badly strafed, within a mile or so of the
enemy. Through the open window from
which all glass had long since vanished,
a swallow entered, and, perching on a
wire stretched across the room, carolled
joyously its <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'simpl'">simple</ins> little song&mdash;a message
truly of peace and eternal hope!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The 'Walthamstow' hut at Remy had
to be temporarily abandoned during the
German offensive. The leader in charge
transferred operations to a dug-out across
the way, which adjoined a clearing station.
The inevitable caterer's boiler enabled him
to keep up a constant supply of hot tea
and coffee for the wounded. An Australian
terribly mutilated was brought in. A
happy smile, a few cheery words, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
cup of steaming hot cocoa made the
Australian feel he had met a friend&mdash;and
speaking slowly, in a voice that was
scarcely louder than a whisper, he said,
'I wonder why I am allowed to suffer
like this,' 'I know why,' replied the
Y.M.C.A. man; 'you are suffering like this
so that two women I love&mdash;my mother and
my sister&mdash;may live in peace and safety
in the north of London. If it were not for
the sacrifices you and thousands of other
boys are making out here, that would be
impossible.' The soldier lad was quiet
for some time, and then whispered to his
new-found friend&mdash;'I'm glad to go on
suffering!'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The same secretary tells an interesting
story of one of the bitter fights round
Passchendaele. The wounded were being
brought in on stretchers, and he was on
the spot with hot drinks for the boys.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
The guns were quiet for a moment and
a voice was heard singing clearly and
distinctly:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Lead Thou me on.</span><br />
The night is dark, and I am far from home;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Lead Thou me on!</span><br />
Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see<br />
The distant scene; one step enough for me.'<br />

<p>The singer was a private, badly wounded
and being carried in on a stretcher. The
subsequent verses were drowned in the
roar of battle, but those standing round
could see from the movement of the
wounded man's lips that he was still
singing. Thus it is possible for a man
to find his Saviour near him even amid the
horror and noise of war.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>One day in 1917 we stood outside a little
Y.M.C.A. at Erquinghem, lost during the
German advance in the following spring,
and standing there we heard 'Grandmother'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
speak. 'Grandmother,' it should be explained,
was a mighty howitzer. It was
concealed under an improvised shed carefully
camouflaged, and was brought out
on rails, in a horizontal position. As
we watched, it was brought to the vertical
and out shot a tongue of flame. The
projectile was so huge we could watch its
flight for miles until it disappeared from
view in the distance. Listening intently
we heard the explosion in the enemy's
lines. Many a Y.M.C.A. on the Western
Front is situated right amid the guns, and
when they are fired one knows it&mdash;'Grandmother'
speaking, seems to shake
the very foundations of the earth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE RED TRIANGLE IN THE EAST</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>The Y.M.C.A. is doing excellent work&mdash;its efforts
are appreciated immensely by all ranks in this force.
Experience of Y.M.C.A. work in the Army has long
since convinced me how invaluable its services are
to us, both in peace and war.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Late Lieut.-General
Sir Stanley Maude.</span></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> Macedonian call 'Come over and help
us' has been repeated in our own days,
and has come from near and far East.
The Red Triangle has been quick to respond
to the call, and a few incidents of its work
are recorded here, though the story itself
must be told after the war. The Chief
Executive officer of the Indian National
Council is himself an Indian, and not only
has he, with the assistance of his Council,
been responsible for the great work of the
Red Triangle in India, but also for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
extensive programme of work the Association
has undertaken for Indian troops in
East Africa, Mesopotamia, and Europe.
In addition to work for British troops in
India, the Y.M.C.A. has established work
for Indian troops in a number of cantonments,
where service parallel to that undertaken
for British troops is carried on, with
the exception that no religious work is
done, unless in the case of Christian
Sepoys.</div>

<p>The number of branches with British
troops on August 1, 1917, was 43, worked
by 40 European and American and 9
Indian secretaries, and 1 honorary lady
secretary. With Indian troops there were
8 branches, worked by 1 European and 8
Indian secretaries. These figures do not
include the temporary work undertaken
by the Army Y.M.C.A. with the Waziristan
Field Force, which terminated during
August 1917, and which included 4 British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and 4 Indian branches, with 3 European
and 2 Indian secretaries. There was also
1 European secretary at Headquarters on
August 1, 1917, for Army work in India;
and in addition secretaries engaged in
civilian Y.M.C.A. work in several stations
gave part of their time to Army work, as
well as many voluntary workers.</p>

<p>In Burma a large barrack-room, made of
wood and bamboo with a grass-thatched
roof, houses the Association, which works
amongst the men of the newly formed
Burmese regiments. The whole building
is on piles, and stands about six feet off
the ground, thus preventing snakes and
other unwelcome guests from coming inside.
The regiments comprise not only
Burmans but Karens, Chinese, and
Arakanese. Most of the men are from the
deep jungle, and very few of them can read
or write. The gramophone interests them
enormously, and they look inside it to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
who is producing the sound, and will sit
round in a circle listening to it for hours.
Picture papers interest them, but usually
they prefer holding the pictures upside
down. The better educated men write a
good deal on the free notepaper provided
by the Y.M.C.A. Quartettes are sung by
Karen and Chinese Christians. At the far
end of the building is a huge image of the
Buddha which was there before we came,
and is used by some of the boys as a sort
of chapel for private devotions. The boys
have to take their choice between Christianity
and Buddhism, and as we have three
exceptionally good lamps there is much
more light at the Y.M.C.A. end of the hall,
and we have the better attendance in
numbers at all events.</p>

<p>Egypt, handicapped at first through lack
of money, has also done magnificently.
There is no more important centre of
Association activity in the world than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Esbekia Gardens in Cairo. Ever since the
early days of the war, night after night,
thousands of khaki-clad warriors have
congregated in these lovely gardens, which
under other auspices might easily have
been one of the danger spots of Cairo,
instead of a kind of modern 'City of
Refuge' from the temptations of the city.
The Anzac hostel is another striking
feature of the work in Cairo. In June 1917
no fewer than 6893 soldiers slept in it,
and that was not by any means a record
month. The money for the purchase of
this hostel as the permanent property of
the Y.M.C.A. has been subscribed by
members of the Baltic, but the discovery
of the existence of a third mortgage has
delayed the completion of the purchase.
At Alexandria, Khartoum, Port Soudan,
on both sides of the canal and far into the
Sinai Peninsula, the Association outposts
have been busy. A Red Triangle hut in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
desert was destroyed by a bomb dropped
from a hostile aeroplane, but when the
smoke subsided, the centre pole was still
standing and the Association flag flying.
The huts at Kantara are amongst the
finest in the world, and neither here nor
anywhere else has it been necessary to put
up a notice intimating that the Y.M.C.A.
is 'open to all,' Tommy knows it, and
regards the Red Triangle as his own peculiar
possession. One cannot conceive of any
place on earth where it is more needed
than in one of these desert camps, where
there is nothing to do, nowhere to go, and
nothing to see but endless stretches of
monotonous and dreary sand. Under such
circumstances the Red Triangle is Tommy's
tuck shop; his church&mdash;with the chaplain
as the parson; his post-office, concert
hall, social room, school, and home. This
is true of every fighting front, and that is
why the Association has won for itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a lasting place in the affections of the
manhood of the Empire.</p>

<p>A young soldier writing home the day
after his arrival in Mesopotamia, said the
first thing he struck on landing was the
welcome sign of the Red Triangle. 'And,'
said he, 'if we are ordered next to the
North Pole, I am sure we shall find it
there!' The Y.M.C.A. secretary for
Mesopotamia tells of a visit he paid to a
centre on the way to Bagdad. It was a
big bare marquee, crammed with men,
with very little furniture in it&mdash;the difficulties
of transport being so great in those
days&mdash;just half a dozen tables and a few
chairs, a heap of books, and a number of
games. There were six inches of dust all
over the floor, and the temperature was
120 degrees in the shade, yet one thing
that attracted the men to the Y.M.C.A.
marquee was that it enabled them to
escape the heat of their own bell tents.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Through the kindness of Sir Alfred Yarrow
a Red Triangle motor launch has since
then been provided for use on the Tigris,
and has greatly simplified transport. The
central Y.M.C.A. at Bagdad is one of the
best of our war buildings, and is situated
on the banks of the Tigris. An Association
centre has been established on the reputed
site of the Garden of Eden.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The story of the Red Triangle in Palestine
is an epic in itself. For months the Association
occupied dug-outs along the Palestine
front, and in those days one secretary
devoted the whole of his time to making
personal purchases for officers and men,
who could not themselves get away to any
centre of civilisation to make purchases
on their own account. Gaza was the first
centre occupied in the Holy Land; Beersheba,
Jaffa, and Jerusalem being occupied
later. At Jaffa the former German<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Consulate was fitted up as a Y.M.C.A., and
the Red Triangle as a matter of course has
made its appearance on a big building in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Malta was a very important centre in
the early days of the war, and the Y.M.C.A.
flourished in its numerous hospital camps.
In Macedonia the work has been difficult,
but greatly appreciated in Salonica itself,
as well as on the Varda and the Struma.
The need has been urgent, and every effort
has been made to meet that need. Transport
difficulties have led to inevitable
delays in the delivery of stores and equipment,
but there are more than forty
centres now, including five for Serbian
soldiers.</p>

<p>The Y.M.C.A. had its part in the ill-fated
expedition to the Dardanelles. Mudros,
Imbros, and Tenedos were centres of
importance in those days, and the Red
Triangle was at work in each island.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
The urgent need of the troops was for soft
drinks, and those ordinary canteen supplies
that give variety to the soldiers' menu, and
make the official rations palatable. The
official canteens were powerless to meet the
demand. We were anxious to help, but
transport was the difficulty. At last,
through the kindness of Lord Nunburnholme,
we were enabled to charter the
s.s. <i>Nero</i> of the Wilson Line, and despatch
it with a cargo of canteen supplies to the
value of eleven thousand pounds to Mudros.
A few days later the Peninsula was
evacuated, but whilst they were there the
men availed themselves to the full of the
opportunity of buying supplementary food
at British prices. When the <i>Nero</i> reached
Mudros, Greek venders were selling our
Tommies tinned fruit at twelve shillings
a tin, and other prices were correspondingly
high.</p>

<p>In the centre of an official photograph<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of Anzac showing the Bay, the camp, and
the surrounding sandhills, are to be seen
the letters 'Y.M.C.A.' They appear on a
tiny marquee and close to it a big dug-out,
measuring 30 by 19 feet, in which the
Red Triangle carried through its programme
of friendliness and good cheer, always
under shell-fire. One night a fragment of
a Turkish shell, weighing twelve and a half
pounds, found its way through the roof
of that dug-out. At Cape Helles there
were three tiny tents fastened end on end.
Had they been larger they could scarcely
have escaped the attention of 'Asiatic
Annie,' the big Turkish gun that dominated
the position. As it was, the Officer Commanding
the advanced base at Lancashire
Landing wrote to Headquarters to say
how much the men appreciated those tents,
and explained that the previous day an
eight-inch high explosive shell from a
Turkish gun had burst in the centre of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
middle tent and completely destroyed it.
'Fortunately,' said he, 'it didn't damage
the piano, and still more fortunately,' he
added, 'it didn't harm the gramophone.'
That was curious, and we thought of some
of the gramophones we had known, and
felt it would have been no disaster if a
shell had destroyed the lot! This gramophone
was different, however, for it had
only just been wound up when the shell
burst, but regardless of the bustle and
confusion caused by the explosion, it kept
on playing until it had finished the last
note of the tune! What a splendid object
lesson for the Allies, to stick to the job
they have on hand to the finish, or in
other words, till victory crowns their
efforts. Many months after the incident
here recorded the Irish Y.M.C.A. was
invited to open up at Rathdrum. The
secretary responsible interviewed the O.C.,
and learning that he was a Catholic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
asked politely if he knew the work of the
Y.M.C.A. 'Indeed I do,' was the reply.
'I was at Cape Helles when a shell burst
in your tent. I was the officer in charge,
and it was my duty to remove casualties.
I went up to the tents fearing the worst,
and shall never forget the smiling face of
the Y.M.C.A. man behind the counter. It
won me over completely.'</p>

<p>A distinguished officer wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Your work has been of inestimable
value to the troops, filling a gap which
it is impossible for the Military
Authorities to provide for. "Always

always be gratefully remembered by
the soldiers in the Great War."'</p></div>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>There</span> are numerous side-lines to this
work, that are important enough in themselves,
the significance of which is scarcely
realised by the general public, or even by
those who are supporting the movement.
Take, for example, the 'Snapshots from
Home' movement, which represented the
combined voluntary work of the photographers
of the United Kingdom, organised
under the Red Triangle. Upwards of
650,000 snapshots were sent out to soldiers
and sailors on active service, each one
bearing a message of love and a reminder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of home. Sir Evelyn Wood, V.C., was one
of the first to recognise the significance of
the letter-writing that is done on such a
large scale in the Y.M.C.A. tents. The
veteran Field-Marshal pointed out that the
benefit was two-fold: first, it occupied the
time of the men; and, secondly, it kept
them in touch with their homes, both
matters of first importance. 'That's what
my Dad always puts on his letters to
Mummy,' said a little girl, pointing to the
Red Triangle on the notepaper, when on a
visit to the Crystal Palace. Fifteen to
twenty million pieces of stationery are
distributed free of charge to the troops
monthly by the Y.M.C.A., and in four
years the total issued amounted to upwards
of nine hundred million pieces. Workers
are often called upon to write letters for
the men, and the latter make all sorts of
mistakes with their correspondence.
Sometimes they stamp their letters but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
forget to address them, often they address
them but forget the stamps. One lad was
greatly excited and wanted the secretary
in charge of the post-office to rescue two
letters he had posted earlier in the afternoon.
When asked why he wanted them
back he blushed like a schoolgirl and
stammered out, 'I've written two letters&mdash;one
to my mother and the other to my
sweetheart&mdash;and I've put them in the
wrong envelopes!' The letters were not
rescued, for more than five thousand had
been posted before he discovered his
mistake, and one wonders what happened!</div>

<p>In Paris the Association has established
a central inquiry bureau under the H&ocirc;tel
&Eacute;douard VII. off the Grand Boulevard.
Two daily excursions are arranged around
Paris, and two each week to Versailles.
Representatives of the Red Triangle meet
all the principal trains, day and night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
The H&ocirc;tel Florida is now run under the
Association for British troops, whilst the
American Y.M.C.A. has its Headquarters
for France in the city, and has taken over
several large hotels and other buildings.</p>

<p>There is not the romance about the work
of the Red Triangle in the munition areas,
that there is in what it is doing for our
fighting men, but there can be no doubt
as to its importance. The munition workers
as a class are as patriotic as any other
class, but their work is drab, monotonous,
and strenuous. Little has been done
officially to bring home to the man who
makes the shell the relationship of his
work to the man who fires it; or of the
woman who works on the aeroplane to the
man who is to fly in it, and yet the one
can do nothing without the other. Things
have changed for the better, but earlier
in the war the output of munitions was
positively hindered by the inadequacy of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the canteen facilities available to the
munition workers. The Y.M.C.A. was the
first organisation to attempt to meet this
need on anything like a large scale, and
eventually the work grew to considerable
dimensions. Our work in the munition
areas has been essentially a ladies' movement,
and has largely consisted of canteen
work. Other features are being increasingly
added, music and singing have been
organised successfully, lectures have been
greatly appreciated, and several big athletic
features introduced. Sporting events, also
cricket and football leagues for munition
workers, have been well supported. It is
intensely interesting to see these people
at work, and no other proof of British
organising power and ability are necessary
than a visit to some of the great works,
many of which were not built for the
purpose of manufacturing munitions of
war, and others improvised since the commencement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of hostilities. At one place in
which a canteen was formally opened by
Princess Helena Victoria&mdash;who has taken
the keenest interest in the development of
our munitions department&mdash;from ordinary
shipbuilding before the war great changes
had taken place: a Super-Dreadnought
was approaching completion; several
T.B.D.'s were on the stocks, and some of
the latest type of submarines were being
built; aeroplanes were being turned out
at an incredible rate; shells made by the
thousand; rigid air-ships were under construction;
and, perhaps as wonderful as
anything, artificial feet were being made
in the same workshops.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Incidentally might be mentioned here,
the work the Association is doing for
officers. There are four large hostels in
London for the accommodation of officers,
and one for officer-cadets. The young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
officer is often not blessed with too much
of this world's goods, and hotel life is
expensive, and not always too comfortable.
The success of these hostels has demonstrated
the need. At Havre, Calais, St.
Omer, &Eacute;taples, and many centres up the
line, as well as in home camps, such as
Ripon, we have the pleasure of doing something
to serve the officer, and in many
English camps we have opened huts for the
exclusive use of officer-cadets. Gidea Park,
Berkhampstead, and Denham were amongst
the first and most successful of these
centres. The interned officers in Switzerland
and Holland are largely catered for
by the Y.M.C.A.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It has been a pleasure to co-operate from
time to time with the work of the R.A.M.C.
and the Red Cross. In huts, in hospitals, and
convalescent camps, in caring for the relatives
of wounded, in work for the walking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
wounded, and in many other ways the Red
Cross and the Red Triangle have worked
closely together. An officer of the R.A.M.C.
(T.), has written the following interesting
description of the work of the Y.M.C.A.
for the walking wounded:&mdash;'The O.C. the
Divisional Walking Wounded Collecting
Post was frankly worried as he sat in his
tiny sandbagged hut with the D.A.D.M.S.,
and talked over all the problems which
faced him in view of the "stunt" due to
come off at dawn a few days later. "I've
got plenty of dressings, and everything
of that sort," he said, "and, of course, I
can get plenty more brought up by returning
ambulance cars. But there is the
question of food&mdash;there's the rub. The
numbers of wounded vary so greatly, and
it's not so easy to lay in a huge reserve of
grub as it is of dressings. Of course, I've
done my best, but I'm rather worried."
"If that is all your worry we'll soon put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
that right," answered the optimist of the
staff. "We'll get the Y.M.C.A. chap on
the job." "What can he do?" "What
can he not do rather? You wait and
see. Come along and we'll call on
him now."</p>

<p>'In a little shed of corrugated iron by the
side of a shell-swept road they found him.
With his coat off and his sleeves rolled up,
he was pushing across the counter steaming
mugs of cocoa and piles of buns to the
crowd of hungry and clamouring Tommies
who besieged his premises. He was not a
young man. Not the strongest-hearted of
Medical Boards would have passed him
for service. To put it briefly, he had no
right in the world to be where he was, in
one of the nastiest corners of that particularly
nasty place, Flanders. But there he
was, roughing it with the rest of them, and
to judge from his smiling countenance,
thoroughly enjoying every particle of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
experience. "Hello, Major!" he called out
cheerfully on seeing his two officer visitors.
"Anything I can do for you to-day?"
"Rather! A whole lot. Can we have a
talk in your own place&mdash;away from the
crowd?" The Y.M.C.A. man led the way
to the six feet square hole in the ground
which he called his billet, and there the
medical staff officer explained his needs.
"There's a stunt on in a few days," he said.
"You may have guessed that. What can
you do to help us? You know the
pressure under which the R.A.M.C. will be
working. It'll be a big job dressing all
the casualties there are likely to be; but
we'll manage that bit. What we want
is a hand in the feeding of them. You
understand?" The face of the secretary
glowed with excitement. "I'll do any
mortal thing I can," he answered eagerly.
"There'll be nothing doing here once the
show starts, so I'll shut down, and bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
my whole stock over to your dressing
station, and my staff too. We can feed
several hundred if you'll let us." "What
about the cost of the grub?" "Not a
word about cost, sir! You're welcome
to it free, gratis, and for nothing, with
all the pleasure in the world." "Thanks
awfully," said the D.A.D.M.S. "That's
just what I wanted you to offer, and I
thought you would; your folks have
helped us so often before." "Jolly good
job," mused the Y.M.C.A. man, "that I
have kept hidden those extra cases of
chocolates and sweet biscuits. I thought
there might be something of this sort
coming off."</p>

<p>'Ere the grey dawn of a certain morning
brought the nerve-racking inferno of
barrage and counter-barrage, the entire
stock of the canteen was installed in the
larger of the two huts which formed the
collecting post. Boxes of biscuits, chocolates,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and cigarettes with the lids knocked
off, stood ranged along the wall, ready for
the tired and hungry guests who would soon
appear. Outside, in two huge cauldrons,
gallons of strong cocoa were brewing
merrily. Little was spoken by the men
standing around, as they waited, nerves a
trifle on edge, for the breaking of the
storm. Suddenly from somewhere in the
rear came the hollow boom of a "heavy,"
the artillery signal, and in an instant every
battery in the area had hurled its first
salvo of the barrage. The air was full of
noise, the rolling roar of the guns at
"drum fire," the hissing and screaming of
flying shells, the echoes of far-away explosions.
The ground trembled as if an
earthquake had come. The battle had
begun.</p>

<p>'The O.C. looked in at the door of the hut.
"Everything ready?" he asked. "Ready
and waiting," answered the Y.M.C.A. man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and very soon in twos and threes the
wounded began to dribble in, and shortly
a steady stream of battered humanity was
straggling down the road, to halt at the
welcome sight of the hut with the Red Cross
flag by its door. How some of them
limped over every weary step of the way
was beyond understanding. With shattered
limbs and mangled flesh they came,
worn, hungry, thirsty, in agony, some
stumbling alone, some helped along by less
grievously injured comrades. In a pitiful
throng they gathered around the dressing
station.</p>

<p>'The quick eyes of the R.A.M.C. sergeant
picked out the worst cases, and these
were hurried into the hut where the
medical officers plied their sorrowful trade.
The others sat down and waited their turn
with the stolid patience of the British
soldier when he is wounded, and among
them worked an Angel of Mercy, an elderly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
angel clad in a flannel shirt, and a pair
of mud-stained khaki trousers. Amid the
poor jetsam of the fight went the Y.M.C.A.
man with his mugs of cocoa and his biscuits,
his chocolate and his cigarettes, as much a
minister of healing as was the surgeon with
his dressings and anodynes. All the men
were bitterly cold after their long night of
waiting in the old front trench, or were
dead beat with the nervous strain of the
action and the pain of their wounds. All
were hungry. A few no longer cared
greatly what more might happen to them,
for they had reached the limit of endurance,
as surely as they had reached the
limit of suffering. But even to those last
the warm drink and the food and, perhaps
more than anything else, the soothing
nicotine, brought back life and hope in place
of apathy and despair. 'God bless you,
sir,' murmured a man here and there.
But the greater part could find no words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to speak the gratitude which their eyes
told forth so clearly.'</p>

<p>This little story is not the tale of one
actual incident. It is only the stereotype
of scenes that have been acted and reacted
often and often at the Front. Time
and time again has the Red Triangle come
to the aid of the Red Cross, placing its
workers and its stores unreservedly at the
disposal of the Royal Army Medical Corps.
When the wounded have been pouring into
the dressing stations in hundreds, the
Y.M.C.A. workers have taken over the
responsibility of feeding them, and have
halved the cares of the overwrought
R.A.M.C. This they have done not once
but unnumbered times, and what gratitude
they have earned from their guests! The
wounded man can scarcely realise what he
owes to the surgeon who tends his injuries;
but he does appreciate his debt to the man
who feeds him and gives him the 'fag'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
for which he has been craving. The cocoa
and cigarettes of the Y.M.C.A. do not
figure among the medicaments of the
Pharmacop&nbsp;ia, yet many a 'walking
wounded' will swear to you that they
have saved his life&mdash;as perhaps they
have.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>THE RED TRIANGLE AND THE WHITE ENSIGN</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>Surely the Almighty God does not intend this war
to be just a hideous fracas, a bloody, drunken orgy.
There must be purpose in it all; improvement must
be born out of it. In what direction? France has
already shown us the way, and has risen out of her
ruined cities with a revival of religion that is most
wonderful. England still remains to be dug out of
the stupor of self-satisfaction and complacency which
the great and flourishing condition has steeped her
in. And until she can be stirred out of this condition,
until a religious revival takes place at home,
just so long will the war continue. When she can
look on the future with humbler eyes and a prayer
on her lips, then we can begin to count the days
towards the end.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Admiral Sir David Beatty,

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">This</span> chapter is written in a 'sleeper' at
the close of a busy day in the North. The
day has been made a memorable one by a
visit to the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, as she lay
at her moorings in one of our great naval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
bases. She is one of the greatest instruments
of war in the world, and it was a
revelation to enter one of the gun turrets of
the super-dreadnought, to look through the
periscope, or see the ingenious mechanism
that moved those mighty guns, and lifts
into position the huge projectile that is
capable of delivering death and destruction
to an enemy many miles away. It was
more than interesting to visit the wireless
rooms, where ceaseless watch is kept by
day and night, and to see the wonderful
orderliness of everything, and to note that
every one on board was ready, and their
only fear that the German Fleet might
never be tempted out again. The visit to
the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> left one thinking of the
service the Red Triangle has been able to
render to the White Ensign. During the
war there are not as many opportunities
for work amongst naval men as in peace
time, but there is all the more need that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
when the men are ashore everything that
is possible should be done for them. The
Scottish National Council have up-to-date
well-equipped hostels and recreation-rooms
in several naval centres, and those at
Edinburgh and Glasgow are thronged with
bluejackets. South of the Border there
are many fine hostels and recreation-rooms
for sailors, and in scores of centres in
England, Wales, and Ireland the Red
Triangle is catering successfully for the
needs of our bluejackets. The biggest
crowd of all is to be found in the quarters
occupied by the Y.M.C.A. at the Crystal
Palace, where thousands of men every day
use the Y.M.C.A. as their club, and find in it
their home. We shall never know all we
owe to our splendid Navy, and that debt
can never be fully paid. At the close of the
war we are planning to erect permanent
hostels and institutes for sailors in several
naval bases at home and in some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
great foreign stations. Much appreciated
war work for sailors is being carried on now
at Brindisi and Taranto, for the men of
the drifters employed on minesweeping
in the Mediterranean, also at Malta,
Mudros, and other centres overseas.</div>

<p>A demand for a Y.M.C.A. on a battleship
came from the men of H.M.S. <i>Conqueror</i>,
and it has been found most helpful.</p>

<p>Many isolated naval stations round the
British coast are supplied with cabinets,
each one containing a gramophone, library,
a supply of writing materials, and games.
For obvious reasons it would be imprudent
whilst the war is on to indicate the centres
by name in which the Red Triangle is
serving the men of the Navy, but there will
be a great story to tell when the war is
over.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>THE RELIGION OF THE RED TRIANGLE</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>The work of the Y.M.C.A. is, to my mind, one of the
outstanding features of this war. Their efforts,
along with other agencies working for the highest
welfare of the Army, have shown a true catholic
spirit, and made it easier for our soldiers to live a
noble, true and clean life. May God's blessing
follow their increasing influence.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Chaplain-General
to the Forces.</span>

<p>The Y.M.C.A. has been one of the really great
things which have come into their own in this
world crisis. It has been a Hindenburg Line of
the Christian faith.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Michael Sadler, Vice-Chancellor
of Leeds University.</span></p></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Y.M.C.A. is not in camp as a rival to
the ordinary Church organisations, nor yet
to supplant or in any conceivable way to
undermine the influence of the chaplains.
Its large and commodious huts and tents
have been used in thousands of camps for
the official Church Parade services, and in
many cases there has been no other suitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
room available. We have counted it a
privilege on Sunday mornings to place our
equipment unreservedly at the disposal of
all the official chaplains who desired to use
it. We have welcomed the opportunity
of assisting the great and important work
the chaplains are doing for the men of His
Majesty's Forces, for the Y.M.C.A. is itself
a wing of the great Christian army, and has
sometimes been described as the Church
in action. Apart from the support in men
and money it has received from members
of the Churches, the war work of the Red
Triangle would have been impossible. The
Y.M.C.A. is not a church, and will never
become one. It administers no sacraments,
its membership is confined to one sex; it
discourages in all its branches the holding
of meetings that clash with those of the
Churches, and in every possible way each
member unattached is encouraged to join
the Church of his choice.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of a striking letter to <i>The
Challenge</i> of July 12, 1918, a correspondent
said:&mdash;'We turn, for an example, to the
Y.M.C.A. Conceal the unpleasant truth
how we may, the outstanding religious
performance of this war in the eyes of the
public at large has not been the daily
services in Church&mdash;not even the Holy
Communion&mdash;but the work done in the
Y.M.C.A. huts. It is along those lines
that we must travel if we are to win the
world. For the medi&aelig;vally-minded, for
the intellectually timid, there is always
Rome. But it is not by those that the new
England will be built, and it is the new
England we must save for Christ.'</p>

<p>Another writer to the same Anglican
journal said it had been stated that 'after
the war there would be a holy Roman
Church and a holy Y.M.C.A., but no more
Church of England.' The fact of the
matter is the Y.M.C.A. is not making the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
work of the Churches unnecessary, but
rather it is giving the ordinary man a new
conception of what Christianity really is,
and is thus helping to interpret the churches
to the masses, and is acting as a bridge or
a communication trench between the
organised forces of Christianity in the front
line, so to speak, and the great masses away
back in reserve, on which they desire to
draw. Some people have spoken sneeringly
of 'canteen religion'; the soldier never
does&mdash;and why should he? There is
nothing new about it, for it is as old as the
early days of Christianity, only the gospel
of the 'cup of cold water' has been adapted
to the needs of modern warfare, so that
the man in the firing-line knows it from
experience as the gospel of the 'cup of hot
coffee.' Straggling back to a clearing
station, wounded, plastered with mud,
and racked with pain, the most eloquent
of sermons would not help him, but a hot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
drink, a few biscuits or even a cigarette,
if given in the name of the Master may put
new heart and life into him, and give him
fresh courage for the way. The Churches
realise this, and have given us of their
best as far as helpers are concerned.</p>

<p>We have a vivid recollection of visiting
the big Y.M.C.A. hut in the Cavalry Camp
at Rouen in 1915. It was the ordinary
week-night service, and more than six
hundred men were present. A famous
Scottish preacher had conducted the service,
and at the close we chatted with him for a
few minutes in the quiet room. 'Before I
came out to France,' said he, 'I knew you
had a great opportunity. Now I know
that the greatest spiritual opportunity in
history rests on your shoulders&mdash;is with
the Y.M.C.A.' And yet there is a way
of doing spiritual work that would make
all spiritual work in camp absolutely
impossible. We remember visiting a big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
hut one day&mdash;it did not sport the Red
Triangle, but was beautifully furnished.
Over the door was a bold device 'A Home
from Home! All Welcome!' On entering,
the first thing one saw was the text
'Behold your sins will find you out!'
And a few yards further on 'The wages
of sin is death.' 'No smoking!' was
another notice, and yet another, 'This
hut will be closed every evening from seven
to eight for a gospel service.' Religion
to appeal to the soldier must be natural
and not forced, and must be free from
controversy and unreality. The British
soldier hates a sham, and instinctively
classes the hypocrite with the Hun. He
may not understand our Shibboleths; he
has no use for our controversies, but he
can and does understand the Life of the
Master, when he sees the beauty of that
Life reflected in some humble follower of
His, who day by day is risking his life at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the Front, that he may supply a cup of
cocoa to a wounded soldier, or who is
slaving behind a Y.M.C.A. refreshment
counter at home, and doing uncongenial
work for the love of Christ.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When it was decided to send the Indian
troops to France, the Y.M.C.A. offered its services
to the Indian Government. The offer
was refused. At last, however, permission
was given to supply recreation marquees for
the use of the Indian Army in France, but
only on condition that there should be no
proselytising, no preaching, no prayers, no
hymn singing, no Testaments or Bibles
given, and no tracts. The Y.M.C.A.
accepted the conditions, and though some
of its friends felt it meant lowering the
flag, it has loyally kept its promise, and
most people realise to-day that this was
one of the greatest pieces of Christian
strategy of our times. A visit to one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Red Triangle huts or tents in an Indian
camp is a revelation. You hear the
Mohammedan call to prayer, see the tiny
mosque, and realise in how many and
varied ways it is possible for the Y.M.C.A.
to be of service to these brave men of
another faith. A professor reported at
one of the big base camps as a worker.
He had come to lecture to the troops, and
when asked by the leader as to his subjects
replied, 'Sanscrit and Arabic.' The
leader wondered how on earth he could
make use of a man as a lecturer to
British Tommies, who only lectured on
those two obscure and difficult topics.
The professor found his niche, however,
teaching the Mohammedan priest to read
his Koran&mdash;the leader commenting&mdash;'The
more he knows it, the less he will
trust it.'</p>

<p>It is interesting to note how well these
Indian heroes get on with our own Tommies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
They play their games and sometimes sing
their songs. When 'Tipperary' was all
the rage, the Indians had their own version
of the chorus, which they sang with great
enthusiasm. It ran thus:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Bura dur hai Tipperary,<br />
Bura dur hai kouch ho,<br />
Bura dur hai Tipperary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sukipas powncheniko,</span><br />
Ram, ram, Piccadilly,<br />
Salam Leicester Square.<br />
Bura, bura dur hai Tipperary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Likem dil hoa pus ghai.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>On one occasion the secretary of an
important base said he had arranged a
new stunt for us that evening&mdash;the formal
opening of a hut in the Indian Cavalry
Hospital Camp. We arrived to find the
hut crowded, and a great banquet arranged
in our honour. Nothing need be said as to
the banquet or its disastrous results as far as
we are concerned! The Indians enjoyed
it, and that was the important thing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Before the banquet we had the privilege
of greeting the men and welcoming them
to the Y.M.C.A., and after we had finished,
the leading Mohammedan in the camp
mounted the platform and gave a great
oration in honour of the Christian Association.
He was followed by the leading
Brahmin, and he in turn by the senior
Sheik, all speaking in most cordial terms of
the Y.M.C.A. In the midst of the orations,
a stately Indian advanced solemnly and
placed a garland of flowers round my neck.
Thrice this garlanding process was repeated
on different occasions&mdash;lovely roses and
sweet peas&mdash;and it was a great and much
appreciated honour, though it made one
feel a trifle foolish at the time. After the
banquet we proceeded to the adjoining
recreation tent, and it was an inspiration to
see it crammed from end to end with men
of many religions and different races, all
happy and contented and all usefully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
employed. On the platform a 'budginee'
or Indian concert was proceeding; a
crowd of men at the tables were learning
to write; another crowd receiving a lesson
in English; a large group looking at
pictures and illustrated magazines, whilst
others were playing games or listening
enraptured to the strains of the Indian
records on the gramophone. The C.O.
who took us round, said that when the
men came to France not one of them could
even sign his name to his pay book, they
all had to do it by means of thumb-prints.
'To-day,' said he, 'every man can sign
his name, and many can write an intelligent
letter, and they have learned everything in
the Y.M.C.A.' A few days previously an
Indian of some rank stood with folded
arms, his back against the wall, in that very
tent. He said nothing, but took in everything,
and when the marquee closed for
the night and the dusky hero warriors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
retired to their tents, he spoke to the Indian
secretary in charge. 'I have watched you
men,' said he; 'you are not paid by the
Government, you come when you like and
you go when you like. There is only one
religion in the world that would send its
servants to do what you are doing&mdash;to
serve and not to proselytise. When this
war is over and we return to India, I want
you to send one of your men to my village.
My people are all Hindus, but they will
do what I tell them. I have been watching
you carefully, and I have come to the conclusion
that Christianity will fit the East
as it can never fit the West.' One of the
lessons of the Red Triangle is that you can
never win men by antagonising them, or
by speaking disrespectfully of the things
they hold dear. Love must ever be the conqueror,
and the love of all loves is the love
of God revealed in His Son, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Our Jewish friends were surprised and
delighted in the dark days at the close of
1914, to find that the doors of the Y.M.C.A.
were thrown widely open to their padres,
who could gather in soldiers of their
community to worship God in their own
way in the huts of the Red Triangle. They
have not been slow to show their appreciation&mdash;several
Y.M.C.A. huts have been
given officially by Jews; one well-known
and much used hostel bears the name
'Jewish Y.M.C.A.,' and Jewish padres will
go to any trouble or inconvenience to help
our work at home or overseas. No Red
Triangle hut can be used for proselytising
by Catholic, Protestant, Moslem, or Jew&mdash;that
goes without saying&mdash;but any official
chaplain is welcome to the use of our huts
for instructing his own people in their own
faith.</p>

<span class="caption">THE Y.M.C.A. AT BASRA, MESOPOTAMIA</span>
</div>

<p>A striking article recently appeared in a
Catholic journal, from which we cull the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
following paragraphs, expressing as they
do another point of view:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'"R.C.," "C. of E.," "Y.M.C.A."&mdash;these
three are the religions of the Front. The drum-head
service, whilst nominally "C. of E.," is, of
course, more a military parade than a religious
function. It is not without a certain amount
of picturesque Army ceremonial, but to the
Catholic soldier, as a Catholic, the spectacle is an
uninteresting one. The Y.M.C.A., too, I think,
would not claim to be a religion. It is perhaps
a religious institution; a kind of spiritual ration-dump.
Its huts, even during a cinema show,
and at the counters where they sell Woodbines
and chocolates, have a Christianised atmosphere.
No soldier fears to be thought "too good" through
attending a Y.M.C.A. service. That is, perhaps,
where its undoubtedly great influence comes in.
It gives the impression, one supposes, to these
soldiers that here they have what the P.S.A.
fraternity call "a man's religion for man." It
caters for the frequent English soul which (perhaps
in the Charity of God) finds a path to Heaven
in the singing of second-rate hymns on Sunday
evening; in the constant repetition of "Abide
with me," and "O God, our help in ages past."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
It is difficult to say if the influence of the Y.M.C.A.
is much responsible for the remarkably even, and
considering all things, somewhat high moral code
of the Army out here. Rather, perhaps (Deo
gratias), it is an English heritage from the past.
Most emphatically one cannot help being struck
by the excellent moral lives that many of these
men live, when all things are considered. Of
course, to a large extent, there is the lack of
occasions of sin. Drunkenness, most possibly,
is rare because the authorities have greatly
restricted, and wisely, the hours of drinking, and
the beer, etc., available, even if taken in large
quantities, is rarely intoxicating. Frankly, it
appears that the good influence of the Y.M.C.A.
is derived from the temporal comforts and conveniences
it offers to the much-tried B.E.F. men.
I stood outside a Y.M.C.A. building one night,
in the worst of weather, weather as foul as it can
be in France in war time. Three rain-sodden
Canadian infantrymen trudged along towards
the place, and their ears caught the sound of
some execrable piano-strumming. "Holy Hell,"
said one, "there's some music there; come on!"
That is the story, in epitome, of the Y.M.C.A.
In the mercy of God, it is a good one."</p></div>

<p>A young soldier sent to an English paper
the following interesting account of a
Communion Service held in one of our huts
at the Front:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'The following Tuesday, just as our company
was going "up the line" to the trenches, a
Communion service was held in the rest-room of
the Y.M.C.A. hut. I attended it along with
nine other men, and the service was conducted
by a well-known Scottish Y.M.C.A. worker, who
at the time was acting as the leader of the hut.
In that little room we ten men in khaki were
verily in the presence of the Unseen. I never
realised Christ to be so near as when we handled
the elements. For myself I can truly say that,
in the grey dawn of the following morning, I went
up to meet the enemy with a strange peace, and
a deep assurance in my soul that, come what
might, I need fear no evil, knowing that He was
with me&mdash;and so it proved to be. Our time in the
trenches was the most exciting I have yet experienced,
but He kept near, and so "all's well."'</p></div>

<h3>STORIES OF THE INVERTED TRIANGLE</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>I am sending you a pound note, the first I ever
received, as I am a poor old woman not able to
work. To maintain my home I used to take in washing,
but now I cannot even do my own, but the
other Sunday, when I shook hands with one that I
used to wash for, he put that bit of paper in my
hand, but said nothing, so I received it as part
payment for work done over seven years ago, and
when I looked at it, I thanked God, and said I
would give it to some good cause, and I think I
cannot do better than help you to get shelter for
the soldiers. God bless 'em.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>More</span> than five hundred thousand men have
signed the War Roll pledge of allegiance
to our Lord Jesus Christ, which has now
been formally adopted by the Churches,
and which reads as follows:</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I hereby pledge my allegiance to
the Lord Jesus Christ, as my Saviour
and King, and by God's help will fight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
His battles for the Victory of His
Kingdom.'</p></div>

<p>Many have no doubt forgotten their
promise, but for many it has meant the
beginning of a new life, and to thousands
of parents the knowledge that the boy,
who was their all, signed this declaration
before making the supreme sacrifice, has
brought untold comfort.</p>

<p>Wherever practicable a Quiet Room for
prayer and Bible study is included in our
camp outfit, also a book-stall for Testaments,
pledge cards, and religious literature.
Millions of Testaments and gospel portions
have been distributed free of charge, and
realising the difficulty of obtaining gospel
booklets or tracts that appeal to men, a
new one from the pen of the General
Secretary was issued each of the first
thirty weeks of the war. The approved
plan has been to have family prayers, no
matter how brief, as far as practicable in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
every hut, every night, and if this feature
of the programme is not popular, the fault
is usually to be found in the one who
leads.</p>

<p>A casual observer, after visiting a
Y.M.C.A. hut, sometimes comes to the
conclusion that the Association is doing a
great social work, but is not much as a
religious force. It is not difficult to understand
that point of view. He has seen
two or three hundred men clamouring at
the refreshment counter for coffee, buns
or cigarettes; the billiard tables have been
fully occupied; hundreds of soldiers were
writing letters at the tables provided for
the purpose, and hundreds joining in some
rowdy chorus, or heartily laughing at a
humorous song or funny sketch. Where
then does the spiritual work of the Red
Triangle come in? The best answer is to
quote what has actually happened.</p>

<p>To the south-west of Salisbury Plain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
there was before the war a tiny village.
To-day it is the centre of a big camp,
which, incidentally, contains several
Y.M.C.A. huts. The leader of No. 4 was
talking to the Church of England padre
one morning. They were warm friends
and the chaplain was frank in his remarks:
'I think you are overdoing it,' said he,
'by having prayers in the hut every night.
Surely it would be better,' he added, 'if you
concentrated on one evening of the week
instead.' 'I have thought and prayed
about it,' replied the leader, 'and it is a
matter of principle with me. These dear
boys are all going to the Front next week,
and no matter what the programme of the
day, I feel we ought to finish at night with
a public acknowledgment of God.' 'Very
good,' replied the padre, 'if that is your
conviction, carry on! Take prayers yourself
this evening.' And he did. He was
no orator; he was not a college man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
neither was he ordained. It was a simple
little service, and did not take more than
ten or fifteen minutes from start to finish.
There was an opening hymn, one of the
old familiar ones, that took the lads away
back to the homes of their childhood. A
short passage of scripture was read, followed
by a few straight but sympathetic words of
exhortation and a brief closing prayer.
That was all, and the same thing, no
doubt, took place in hundreds of centres
the same night. Prayers over and the
'King' sung, the leader came down from
the platform, where a young private greeted
him and shook his hand till it hurt saying,
'I want to thank you for giving me a new
vision of a God I once knew.' Walking
towards the centre of the hall, a young
subaltern greeted him saying, 'I want to
thank you for that little service; it has
been no end of a help to me, and I should
like to give you this for your work,' so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
saying he handed him an envelope, and
looking inside he found a letter from the
lieutenant's mother, containing thirty
shillings in postal orders to be spent by
him in camp. The service had helped him,
and that was his thankoffering. The hut
cleared, the men retired for the night to
their sleeping quarters. A solitary soldier
lingered by the doorway as if he wanted
some one to speak to him. 'Good-night,
my lad,' said the leader, 'can I do anything
for you?' Instead of replying the soldier
burst out crying, and later said, 'If you will
you can save me from a great crime!'
'Save you from a crime&mdash;whatever do
you mean?' And then the trooper told
his story. There was nothing uncommon
about it. He and his brother had made
love to the same girl, their mother had
intervened, 'and,' he said, 'I have written
to my mother this evening a letter that no
boy should write to his mother, and after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
attending your service to-night, I feel I
would give all I've got to take back that
letter!' The letter was found and destroyed,
and the soldier rejoiced in what
he regarded as a great deliverance. This
is no story of an orthodox revival, but of
the kind of thing that may be taking place
hundreds of times any week.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the early days the famous &mdash;&mdash;
Division assembled in one of the great
camps near Winchester. Regiments and
units were there from India, South Africa&mdash;from
all parts of the world. Rain came
down in torrents and the mud was appalling.
The huge Red Triangle tents were
crowded from morning till night and the
devoted workers, all too few in number,
had neither time nor strength for religious
work in the ordinary acceptance of the
term. They could have limited their
canteen work, and closed the refreshment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
counter excepting for a few hours daily.
That would have been the easier plan,
and would have given them the opportunity
of devoting themselves to concerts
and meetings in the evenings. The alternative
would have been to spend and be
spent in serving the material needs of the
men, trusting that God would use the
atmosphere of the place and the personal
contact of the workers to influence the
men, and thus make up for their inability
to do much in the meeting line. They
chose the latter plan, and the leader
retiring for the night would throw himself
on his bed and sometimes fall asleep
without undressing. At times suffering
from the reaction, he would ask himself
the question, 'Is it worth while? Am I
doing the right thing?' The answer came
the night before the men left for the Front.
It had been a record day, every moment
had been crowded, and they had sold out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
The majority had retired for the night, a
few remained to tidy up the tents. This
task accomplished, a group of soldiers
gathered round the leader, and the talk
soon turned quite naturally to some of the
deepest problems of life. Presently a stalwart
young Gordon Highlander told of his
home in far away Scotland, of his farewell
to his dear old mother before he went out
to India, and of the promise he made her&mdash;the
promise he had not kept&mdash;to read his
Bible every day, to lead a pure clean life, and
to keep clear of drink. The atmosphere
of that crowded Y.M.C.A. tent had brought
it all back to him and, unknown to the
staff, he had renewed his vows to God and
his mother. In making this confession
he was overcome by emotion, and throwing
his arms round the leader's neck he sobbed
out the story of his repentance. There is
no more moving sight than the anguish of
a strong man, probably no sight that gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
more joy in Heaven than the tears that tell
of the return of the one that had been lost.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A young Canadian officer who had lost
a leg and an arm wrote to me before sailing
to Montreal from Bristol in May 1918, and
this is what he said:&mdash;'I would like to tell
you how much we have appreciated the
Y.M.C.A. I came over with the first batch
of Canadians; we were drafted to Larkhill,
Salisbury Plain. After leaving my home&mdash;a
godly home&mdash;I fell into the hands of
very ungodly people and sank very, very
deep in. I was lying on the roadside much
the worse for drink. I was down and
couldn't get up; comrades and every one
seemed to have left me. I saw one of
your cars rush by. When it had passed
about a hundred yards, out jumped a
Y.M.C.A. man. He came back to me and
said, "Come along my friend, I will take
you to your hut." I looked at him and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
said, "I've sunk too low for a man like
you to touch me." He helped me up,
took me to my hut, and said, "This is my
work in the Y.M.C.A., to help the helpless.
Come in and have a cup of tea with me
to-morrow." Shamefaced, I went the next
day. He was there to greet me; he talked
and prayed with me, but I saw no light
until one night in the trenches, I thought
I heard this man praying, and I heard it
again and again, and had no rest till I
laid my sins at the foot of the Cross.
Although I am going home with a leg and
an arm off, I have a clean heart washed in
the Blood of the Lamb. I have visited
many huts, but that was the only man who
spoke to me personally about my sinful
condition. Your leaders can do much if
they will. God bless the work and the
workers. I will enclose this leader's card so
that you can let him know his prayers followed
me up to the trenches. God bless him!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Cecil Thompson, the leader referred to,
never saw this letter. Long before it was
written he had 'gone west,' had passed to
his reward, one of the Red Triangle martyrs
of Salisbury Plain. But he 'shall in no
wise lose his reward,' for it is work like
this that pays, and the spirit of Cecil
Thompson lives on in the lives of those
who have been won, not by his eloquence,
but by the personal contact of a man who
had yielded himself to become a channel
for the Divine blessing.</p>

<p>The greatest romance of the Red Triangle
is the romance of its religious work. War
always seems to have one of two effects
upon the lives of those who participate in
it&mdash;either it hardens a man and makes
him callous, or else it purifies and ennobles
him. The Chaplains, the Churches, the
Y.M.C.A., the Church Army, the C.E.T.S.,
the Salvation Army, and countless other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
organisations and individuals are always
at work, trying to counteract the power of
the downward pull. It was our youngest
General, the late Brig.-Gen. R. B. Bradford,
V.C., M.C., who addressed to his men in
France, shortly before his death, the
following stirring words:&mdash;'I am going to
ask you to put your implicit trust and
confidence in me, to look upon me not only
as your Brigadier, but as your friend. By
the help of God I will try and lead you to
the best of my ability, and remember your
interests are my interests. As you all
know, a few days from now we are going to
attack; your powers of endurance are going
to be tested. They must not fail you.
Above all, pray; more things are wrought
by prayer than this world dreams of. It
is God alone who can give us the victory,
and bring us through this battle safely.'</p>

<p>It is said that General Smuts' attention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
was drawn to Herbert Schmalz's picture,
'The Silent Witness,' in the Royal Academy.
It showed the interior of a French church,
and many wearied and wounded French
soldiers huddled together on the floor.
A soldier with a wounded arm was awakened
by the pain, and raising himself on
his unwounded arm saw the figure of the
Christ, the silent witness of his suffering
and agony. Looking long and earnestly
at the picture, it is said the famous Boer
General quietly remarked, 'Many a man
has seen that vision in this war.'</p>

<p>When visiting Bailleul in 1917 the
following story was told me by a distinguished
padre serving with the Y.M.C.A.
It concerned a casualty clearing station
on the outskirts of the town. A gentleman
ranker was brought in terribly wounded.
His shoulder had been shattered by
shrapnel and gas gangrene had set in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
A constant and welcome visitor was the
senior chaplain. One day he called, and
said cheerily, 'Well, old fellow, how goes
it to-day?' 'Thanks, padre,' was the
reply, 'the pain is not quite so bad to-day,
but, padre,' he added earnestly, stroking
his wounded arm, 'I wish you would
persuade them to take this away.' 'Don't
talk like that,' said the chaplain; 'you'll
want to use that old arm for many a year
to come!' 'No, padre,' he replied with
conviction, 'I shall never use it again;
I'm going west!' A moment later he
was seized with a frightful paroxysm of
pain, and with a torrent of oaths shrieked
out, 'Why the b&mdash;&mdash; h&mdash;&mdash; can't they take
this arm away!' He fell back exhausted,
but an instant later sat bolt upright and
with arms held out looked intently towards
the roof of the hut. His face became
radiant, and there was no trace of pain.
In an ecstatic voice he cried out, 'Jesus!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Jesus! Jesus!' and fell back dead.
Thank God that's possible, and even in
the hour of death, the blasphemer may
receive forgiveness and the knowledge of
salvation, for</p>

<p>A lady worker in the Isle of Wight felt
unaccountably drawn to a young soldier
who had vowed he would never enter the
Y.M.C.A. again, because he objected to
evening prayers. Little by little she won
his confidence, until the night before he
left for France with a draft, he came in to
say good-bye, and told her she was the first
person to speak to him about sacred things,
adding&mdash;'I may do some day, but at
present I cannot see things as you do.' He
went to France, followed by her prayers,
and in due course took part in the famous
attack on Cambrai. Nothing was heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of him for weeks, and his friends were
forced to the conclusion that he was
numbered amongst the dead. Time passed
by, until one morning the lady of the Red
Triangle received a letter from him, written
from a German prisoner of war camp.
It was a commonplace letter and told of
the great fight, of his capture and internment,
and so forth, but the concluding
words were the ones she wanted&mdash;'You
will be glad to know I can see things as
you do now.'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We were speaking at the opening of a
hut near Portsmouth. At the close of the
ceremony a dear little old widow lady,
sitting in the front row, told us of her
own boy. He was a young officer serving
in France, and was called out late one
night to help repel a sudden attack by the
enemy. Shot down by machine-gun fire,
a brother officer stooped to help him, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
he cried, 'Lead on, lead forward, I go to
my God!'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A day later another Y.M.C.A. lady in
one of the hospital huts told us the story
of her nephew. He, too, was a young
officer, and was called out to assist in
repelling a sudden attack by the Huns.
Our men had scarcely reached No Man's
Land when the enemy turned on their
dreadful gas. One of the first to be overcome
by its fumes was the sergeant of his
platoon. Regardless of the risk he ran,
that young officer stuck to his disabled
sergeant until help arrived. Not realising
that he had himself become affected by
the noxious fumes, he tried to stagger to
his feet, but fell backwards into a shell-hole,
and in falling broke his neck. The
sad news was conveyed to his people in the
North of England, and the night they
received it his father and mother sat alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
in the quiet of their home. Presently the
mother spoke&mdash;'I feel,' said she, 'that the
only thing that would console me in my
loss would be to know that the man for
whom my boy died was a good man.'
It was only a week later that the sergeant
for whom the young officer died, came to
that home, and when he came he was
hopelessly intoxicated. The parents quickly
ascertained that it was not the case of
a man having been overcome by sudden
temptation; they could have forgiven that,
but he was an utter waster, about as bad
as a man could be. When he had left the
house those two sat once again in the
silence of their home, and it was the
mother who spoke, slowly and quietly,
'It almost breaks my heart to know my
boy gave his precious life for a worthless
life like that.' And yet, what of the
young officer himself? Did he know the
type of man it was for whom he was about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to make the supreme sacrifice? Of course,
he knew; he was in his own platoon, and
yet, knowing, he willingly gave his life
in an attempt to save him. One cannot
recall this story without thinking of those
wonderful words: 'For scarcely for a
righteous man will one die: yet per-adventure
for a good man some would even
dare to die, but God commendeth His
Love towards us, in that, while we were
yet sinners, Christ died for us.'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In a far away corner of the Harfleur
Valley the Y.M.C.A. has one of its finest
equipments. The leader was a great man
in every sense of the word, and every
night he organised a sing-song for the
troops, which invariably went with a
swing. He seemed to know by instinct
when to strike right in, and what to say. A
night came, however, when he seemed to
have struck a bad patch, for no one would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
play, sing, or recite. The story is told
here almost word for word, as it was first
told me by a leading worker home from
France, who drew a graphic word picture
of the hut leader pleading from the platform
for help which never came. The huge
hut was crammed with men, and looking
at the crowd standing at the back he
noticed a movement amongst them. A
trooper detaching himself from the crowd
slowly elbowed his way to the front. It
was easy to tell by his unsteady steps that
he was under the influence of drink.
Mounting the platform, he turned first
to the audience and then to the Y.M.C.A.
leader, and cried in a voice that every one
could hear: 'What's the matter, Boss?
Won't any one oblige you? Never mind,
padre, if nobody will help you, I will!
What would you like me to do? I can
play, or I can sing, or I can recite&mdash;or I can
pray!' For a moment the secretary did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
not know what to reply. He was a man
of experience, but had never been placed
in a predicament like that before. To
his horror he saw the poor drunken trooper
stumble to the edge of the platform and
with hands outstretched called for prayer,
and there followed one of the strangest
prayers ever heard in public as the drunkard
cried out, 'Everlasting God! Everlasting
God! Everlasting God&mdash;&mdash;!' He could
get no further, but broke down and sobbed
like a child, and in his agony cried out,
'I had a good mother once; I've been a
damned fool. May God forgive me!'
Could God possibly hear and answer a
prayer like that? Of course He could,
and He did! Possibly He would rather
have even a prayer like that, than the
meaningless prayers with which we sometimes
mock Him, and if any man ever
gave evidence of his conversion to God
it was that trooper. He stayed only four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
days longer in that reinforcement camp
in the Harfleur Valley, but if he could help
it, never for a moment would he let our
leader out of his sight, and in a hundred
ways he helped him with his work. He
would go methodically and frequently
round the hut, gather up the dirty mugs,
bring them back to the counter and help
to wash them. He would go down on his
hands and knees under the tables, pick
up scraps of paper and cigarette ends and
help clean up the floor. Four days later
he was sent with a detachment up the line;
three days later still, with his company,
he was ordered 'over the top,' and literally
he went into the 'Valley of the Shadow
of Death,' but he did not go alone, for
'there went with him One the form of
Whom was like unto the form of the Son
of God!'</p>

<p>The Y.M.C.A. is a Christian Association,
the Red Triangle a Christian emblem, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
for that very reason the freedom of the
Association is given to every enlisted man.
Protestant and Catholic, Anglican, Free-Churchman,
Jew, Hindoo, Mohammedan&mdash;men
of any religion, every religion, and no
religion at all, are equally welcomed beneath
its roof, and no man will ever hear
unkind or disrespectful things said from
a Y.M.C.A. platform concerning the faith
he holds dear. At the same time we can
never forget that the greatest need of every
man, amongst the millions we serve in our
huts, is that he should have a Friend who
will never fail him nor forsake him, who
will stand shoulder to shoulder with him
in his fierce fight with temptation in camp
or city, will be with him in the trenches, in
the firing line, as he goes over the parapet,
or even into the dread 'Valley of the
Shadow,' and there is only One Who can
thus meet every need of every man, and
that One is the strong Son of God, the Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Jesus Christ, the best Friend, the truest
Comrade we can have.</p>

<p>We often fall far short of our aim, alas!
but the primary aim of the Y.M.C.A. always
has been, and is, to lead men to a saving
knowledge of that Friend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>THE RED TRIANGLE IN THE RECONSTRUCTION</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>The Y.M.C.A. has a very thorough understanding
of men, and with that sympathy which has characterised
its work throughout has brought to the
National Employment Exchange system an element
which has humanised the movement.

<p>The state of the Labour Market and the condition
of trade after the lapse of the period of reconstruction
following the war will be so favourable that the
physically fit man will experience little difficulty in
securing employment, but even if that is so we shall,
for a long time, have with us the disabled man, who,
without assistance and guidance, cannot be suitably
placed in industry. We must see an extension of
the good-will and sympathy evinced by the
Y.M.C.A. movement amongst every class in the
community.</p>

<p>The Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Labour
are getting up a special department to deal with the
discharged soldier. What the Y.M.C.A. contributes
to this problem is character.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mr. G. H.
Roberts, M.P., Minister of Labour.</span></p></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> question is often asked 'What is going
to be done with the Y.M.C.A. huts after
the war?' It is never easy to prophesy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
with any degree of certainty, but there
can be little doubt that, properly handled,
these huts will be at least as useful after
the war as they are now. Their furniture,
which comprises hundreds of billiard tables,
thousands of chairs, tables, stoves, ranges,
and so forth, is well fitted for doing good
service after the war. One of these huts
planted down in the centre of some rural
community and staffed by voluntary
workers, who have purchased their experience
by downright hard service during
the war, should be an inestimable boon.
It would break the monotony of country
life; or, being set down in an industrial
district of a big town or city, would help
in congenial ways to relieve the tedium
of the drab life of the workers.</div>

<p>The immediate problem is that of the
discharged man. Incidentally his presence
in our midst is even now helping us to gain
that practical acquaintance with his needs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
that will be invaluable in dealing with the
greater problem of demobilisation. Thousands
of men are discharged from the Navy
and Army every week. Many of these for
months, it may be for years to come, will
not be able to do a good day's work, no
matter how willing they may be, and it is
up to us to help them. No one who has
seen the conditions under which they have
been living in Picardy or in Flanders can
wonder at this, and they will need sympathy
and encouragement on the part of their
employers. The Y.M.C.A. can supply the
human touch that may be of the greatest
possible service to the Ministries of
Labour, Pensions, and Reconstruction, and
although the State itself must take responsibility
for the future of those who
return broken from the war and for their
dependents, there will still be ample room
for voluntary effort without any taint of
charity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>A number of experiments are being tried,
all designed to point the way to future
efforts if such experiments prove successful.
The Red Triangle Farm Colony at Kinson
in Dorset has been fitted up as a sanatorium
for the benefit of men discharged from the
Navy and Army who need sanatorium
treatment because they are suffering from,
or threatened with, consumption, and
whilst the men are undergoing treatment
they are trained in poultry-farming, horticulture,
and other outdoor pursuits on
plans cordially approved by the authorities.</p>

<p>A Red Triangle Poultry Farm in Surrey
is also run entirely for the benefit of discharged
men, and a somewhat larger
venture is under way in Suffolk with a
two hundred acre farm and extensive fruit
gardens. At Portsmouth and other centres
hostel accommodation is provided for men
who, on leaving the Navy or Army, go
through a course of training for civil life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Experimental workshops in London are
proving a great success, discharged soldiers
being trained in carpentry, joinery, picture-framing,
and the repairing of pianos.</p>

<p>A series of exhibitions dealing with the
work of ex-soldiers has been successfully
inaugurated, and Red Triangle employment
bureaux have already secured situations
for more than twenty thousand
discharged men.</p>

<p>The biggest opportunity for the Red
Triangle will come with the declaration of
peace. 'After the war' for tens of thousands
of men has commenced already,
and not only during the war, but in the
reconstruction we shall need the help of
every worker who is prepared heart and
soul to work out the full programme of
the Red Triangle for Britain's sake and
for the sake of the Kingdom of God.</p>
